Client-side layer: `@hogsend/js` (zero-dependency browser core — identity, capture, preferences, in-app feed, banners, toasts, reactive store) and `@hogsend/react` (provider, hooks, and the `NotificationBell`/`FeedPopover`/`NotificationFeed`/`Banner`/`Toast` components with a `--hs-*` themed override surface), plus the engine pieces that power them:

- Publishable-key (`pk_`) browser-ingest auth (`requirePublishableOrIngest`, per-key origin allowlist, `allowed_origins` migration, reflective CORS, `GET /v1/lists/preferences`).
- The in-app feed backend: `feed_items` table, `sendFeedItem()` + `send-feed` workflow, recipient-scoped `/v1/feed/*` routes with SSE fan-out.
- `sendBanner()` on the feed primitive, and the server-side `generateUserToken` mint helper for identified browser sessions.

Every client interaction is a first-party `inapp.*`/`banner.*` event through the ingest spine, so it can trigger a journey and fan to PostHog. `@hogsend/js` and `@hogsend/react` ride the engine version line but are opt-in (not `create-hogsend` scaffold defaults).
