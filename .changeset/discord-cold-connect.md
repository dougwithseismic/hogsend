feat(plugin-discord): adopt the cold-connect link-confirm flow (drop the typed-code /verify)

Refactors `@hogsend/plugin-discord` onto the engine `createColdConnect()` primitive so Discord linking matches Telegram: `/link <email>` → emailed one-click confirm LINK → click → the engine-served connect page binds `discord_id` + email onto one contact + client-identifies. **`/verify` and the typed-code path are removed.**

- **`@hogsend/plugin-discord`** — `InteractionDeps` is reworked (breaking): the code-flow callbacks (`mintCode`, `sendLinkCode`, `redeemCode`, `recordVerifyAttempt`) are dropped in favour of a single consumer-supplied **`requestConfirm({ discordUserId, email }) → { ok } | { ok: false, reason }`** that mints a server-sealed cold-connect token and emails the confirm link (the token never reaches the handler). The Enter-code component/modal, the `/verify` slash command, and the `CODE_MODAL`/`ENTER_CODE_BUTTON` custom-ids are deleted; `CustomIds` is now just `{ EMAIL_MODAL }`. The mint throttle moved entirely into `mintConfirm` (Redis-INCR, fail-closed). New export: `RequestConfirmResult`.
- **`member_link` OAuth path is preserved** — its `resolveContact` (which runs `linkContact` + role-grant + the `discord.linked` emit for the operator/known-contact web-bind) is kept and is used ONLY by the OAuth branch, not the `/link` interactions path. Both bind paths stay at parity: `/link` grants the role via the cold-connect `afterBind` + emits via the exchange's `ingestEvent`; the OAuth branch keeps doing it via `resolveContact`.
- **`apps/api`** is the in-monorepo reference consumer: it constructs `discordColdConnect = createColdConnect({ identityKind: "discordId", platformKey: id => id, buildIngest: scalar discordId, … })`, wires `requestConfirm` to `mintConfirm` + the transactional confirm email, and mounts the routes via the array form of `CreateAppOptions.routes`. The now-orphaned `transactional/discord-link-code` template is removed.

The remaining engine-line packages are version-only bumps to keep the engine release line uniform.
