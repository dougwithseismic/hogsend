`@hogsend/react`: responsive in-app feed + survey card. The feed now sets its own type baseline so notification items don't balloon to a large host font-size, bodies are sized and muted for readability, and the `scale`/`nps` survey scale flows as a single shrink-to-fit row instead of wrapping into a ragged grid in narrow feeds (including the 380px bell popover).
