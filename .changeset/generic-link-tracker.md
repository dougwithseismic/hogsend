feat(links): generic first-party link tracker — mint, manage, and stitch tracked links outside email

Extracts the email link-tracking machinery into a channel-agnostic primitive so any
channel (Studio, Discord, SMS, share links) can mint first-party tracked links.

- **`@hogsend/engine`**: new `mintLink({ db, url, baseUrl, source, type, label?, campaign?, distinctId?, createdBy? })` — the managed counterpart to the email HTML-rewrite path. Inserts a durable `links` row (operator/campaign identity) plus a `tracked_links` click-counter row that back-references it via `link_id`, and returns the `/v1/t/c/:id` redirect URL. Email is unchanged: it keeps rewriting HTML at send time with `tracked_links.link_id` NULL, so the two stay independent consumers of the same click spine.
- **Share-safe by construction**: a link is identity-bearing (carries a `distinctId` the click can stitch) ONLY when `type: "personal"`. A `public` link NEVER carries a person token — a reshared public link attributes by campaign only. Destinations are validated http(s) at mint time (closes the latent open-redirect).
- **Single-use identity-token burn**: the `hs_t` redirect token is now single-use — the first `POST /v1/t/identify` exchange wins; a replayed/reshared token is a 200 no-op (Redis `SET NX` on a sha256 of the token, TTL = token lifetime). Best-effort: a Redis fault degrades to the pre-burn behaviour rather than coupling the exchange to Redis liveness.
- **`@hogsend/studio`**: a new "Links" view to create and manage tracked links (mint personal/public links, copy the short URL, view per-link click counts, archive). Backed by admin CRUD at `/v1/admin/links` (list/get/create/update/archive), with the click count computed on read from `tracked_links.click_count`.
- **`@hogsend/db`**: new `links` table + `tracked_links.link_id` FK (additive migration `0028`).

The remaining engine-line packages are version-only bumps to keep the engine release line uniform (the scaffold pins `^ENGINE_VERSION`).
