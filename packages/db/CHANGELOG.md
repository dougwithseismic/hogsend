- 4153964: feat(email): provider-neutral EmailEvent + HTML-only send wire

  The breaking contract change that makes "the EmailProvider is the swappable
  wire" actually true. The provider contract in `@hogsend/core` no longer
  traffics in Resend's wire shapes.

  What changed (compile-caught, plus one deprecated alias for handler bodies):

  - **`EmailEvent` replaces the Resend-shaped webhook union.**
    `verifyWebhook`/`parseWebhook` now return a provider-neutral `EmailEvent`
    (`{ type, messageId, recipients, occurredAt, bounce?, click?, raw }`,
    `email.` event-type prefix kept). `verifyWebhook` MAY be async. New
    `WebhookHandshakeSignal` lets a provider 200 a non-status handshake
    (SNS confirm, Postmark subscription change) without the route sniffing the
    body.
  - **HTML-only send wire.** `SendEmailOptions`/`BatchEmailItem` drop
    `react?: ReactElement` — `html` is now required, `text` optional. The engine
    ALWAYS renders React → HTML itself before `provider.send`. React Email stays
    first-class for template authoring AND Studio preview; only the provider wire
    is HTML. `@hogsend/core` no longer depends on React.
  - **Neutral tagging.** The provider wire keeps a neutral
    `tags?: Array<{ name; value }>` — the most portable shape (SES uses it
    verbatim; Postmark maps first → `Tag` + all → `Metadata`; Resend passes it
    through). The higher-level engine send API (`EmailServiceSendOptions.tags`,
    `POST /v1/emails`) is unchanged.
  - **New opt-in provider `@hogsend/plugin-postmark`.** Postmark support behind
    `createPostmarkProvider` / `EMAIL_PROVIDER=postmark` — native open/click
    tracking forced off (first-party is sovereign), fail-closed webhook auth. It
    is an `optionalDependency` of the engine (guarded dynamic import gated on
    `POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN`), so the engine installs/ships fine without it. NOTE:
    its FIRST npm publish must be MANUAL — CI cannot create a brand-new
    `@hogsend/*` package.
  - **Bounce normalization + suppression.** `dispatchWebhook` reads `EmailEvent`
    fields and persists `bounce.class → bounceType`, `bounce.reason →
bounceReason`. Auto-suppression now fires ONLY on `class === 'permanent'`;
    transient/soft bounces are RECORDED as `email.bounced` (class `transient`) but
    do NOT increment the suppression counter — the old `delivery_delayed` no-op is
    gone. `handleBounce`/`handleComplaint` iterate ALL `event.recipients`
    (de-duped, capped at 100 to avoid a fan-out mass-suppression).
  - **Per-provider secrets.** The mailer-level `EmailServiceConfig.webhookSecret`
    hard-gate is removed; each provider owns its own webhook secret at
    construction. The webhook route resolves the provider, verifies, and hands
    `handleWebhook(event, providerId)` an already-verified `EmailEvent`.
  - **Tracking sovereignty.** At boot, if the active provider declares
    `capabilities.nativeTracking: true` (Resend), the engine logs a WARN that
    account-level native tracking must be disabled (first-party is the source of
    truth). The outbound-echo suppression for provider open/click is retained.

  **Escape hatch (one minor):** `LegacyResendWebhookEvent` (= the frozen Resend
  union) is shipped `@deprecated`. A `webhookHandler` body that still reads the
  old nested shape can cast `event.raw as LegacyResendWebhookEvent` while
  migrating to `EmailEvent` fields (`event.messageId`, `event.bounce`,
  `event.recipients`). The old `WebhookEvent`/`WebhookEventType` exports remain
  `@deprecated` for one minor and are removed the following minor.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 7229385: feat: outbound destinations on the delivery spine (PostHog/Segment/Slack)

  Turns the durable outbound webhook spine into a fan-out engine: a new
  `kind` column on `webhook_endpoints` selects a delivery-time TRANSFORM adapter,
  so a keyed destination (PostHog, Segment, Slack, or a code-defined
  `defineDestination()`) reuses ALL the existing retry/backoff/DLQ/reaper/CAS
  machinery — only the per-vendor HTTP projection differs. The default
  `kind="webhook"` signed Standard-Webhooks POST is byte-identical to before.
  `@hogsend/client` and `@hogsend/engine` move together on this version line so
  the SDK types can never describe a server response shape the engine does not
  yet return.

  ## Consumer-visible behavioral changes (read before upgrading)

  - **BREAKING: `ctx.posthog.capture` and `ctx.identify` were REMOVED from the
    journey context.** These were single-vendor, fire-and-forget PostHog shims;
    they no longer exist on `JourneyContext` (`@hogsend/core`). Now that PostHog is
    just one outbound DESTINATION among many, the journey context exposes only
    vendor-neutral orchestration primitives (`sleep`, `sleepUntil`, `when`,
    `waitForEvent`, `checkpoint`, `trigger`, `guard`, `history`). To send the
    lifecycle catalog (`contact.*`, `email.*`, `journey.completed`, `bucket.*`) to
    PostHog/Segment/Slack/a CRM, configure an outbound destination. For a custom
    journey signal, fire `ctx.trigger()` (it joins the internal pipeline) and
    capture it where you detect it via your app's PostHog SDK. The `PostHogService`
    provider itself is unchanged and still load-bearing for the identity PULL
    (`getPersonProperties` → timezone resolution) and the opt-in
    `bucket.syncToPostHog` person-property mirror.

  - **Open/click are now PER-HIT, not first-touch.** Previously `email.opened` /
    `email.clicked` emitted exactly ONCE per send (a first-touch gate plus a
    per-send `dedupeKey` of `email.opened:<id>` / `email.clicked:<id>`). They now
    emit on EVERY open and EVERY click with NO `dedupeKey`, so every hit is a
    distinct delivery to every subscribed endpoint. This is intentional — every
    destination must receive every engagement event — and it is the right shape
    for product-analytics destinations (PostHog/Segment per-hit funnels). The
    per-delivery wire bytes for `kind="webhook"` subscribers are UNCHANGED, but a
    live subscriber to `email.opened` / `email.clicked` will now receive many
    deliveries per send instead of one. This is defensible under the documented
    at-least-once + `Webhook-Id` dedup model (each delivery still carries a unique
    `Webhook-Id`), but it is NOT a no-op for existing production endpoints
    subscribed to those two events — size your consumer + dedup accordingly. The
    row-level `emailSends.openedAt` / `clickedAt` first-touch state is unchanged.

  - **`@hogsend/client` outbound-webhook return types gained nullability** to
    model keyed destinations (which carry no signing secret). `WebhookEndpoint.secretPrefix`
    is now `string | null` (null for `kind !== "webhook"`), and
    `CreatedWebhookEndpoint` is now `WebhookEndpoint & { secret?: string }` (the
    full secret is present only for `kind="webhook"`). Under `strictNullChecks`,
    consumer code that read `endpoint.secretPrefix` as a non-null `string`, or
    `created.secret` as a guaranteed `string` on the create/rotate "store it now"
    flow, will get a TS error — narrow before use (the secret is still always
    present for `kind="webhook"` creates at runtime). This ships in lockstep with
    the engine route change that makes the server actually return those nulls.

  - **The admin `kind` enum now accepts every shipped preset.** `POST`/`PATCH
/v1/admin/webhooks` previously rejected `kind` values other than
    `"webhook"`/`"posthog"` with a 400; it now accepts any shipped preset id
    (`webhook`, `posthog`, `segment`, `slack`), derived from `PRESET_DESTINATIONS`
    so the catalog stays the single source of truth. This makes the
    admin-API / `hs.webhooks` SDK path documented in the destinations skill +
    `env.example` actually reachable for `segment`/`slack` endpoints (a `kind`
    whose transform is not registered at delivery still DLQs as a config error).

  ## What's new

  - `defineDestination()` + a `DestinationRegistry`, threaded into
    `createHogsendClient({ destinations })` and `createWorker`. Four shipped
    presets: `webhook` (default), `posthog`, `segment`, `slack`.
  - `ENABLED_DESTINATION_PRESETS` env (csv / `*` / `none`) selects which optional
    presets register; `webhook` + `posthog` are always on. Destination credentials
    are per-endpoint in `webhook_endpoints.config`, never env vars.
  - `ENABLE_POSTHOG_DESTINATION` auto-seeds one `kind="posthog"` endpoint on the
    email funnel so the full email lifecycle fans out to PostHog DURABLY.
  - A new `hogsend-authoring-destinations` skill.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e2e254c: feat: outbound webhooks + integration presets

  Adds a Svix-style HMAC-signed outbound webhook stream — a 12-event catalog,
  managed endpoints (`/v1/admin/webhooks` CRUD + rotate-secret + test), and
  durable delivery (per-endpoint retry/backoff, dead-letter, and a 1-minute
  reaper that re-drives due retries and recovers orphaned `sending` rows). The
  `hs.webhooks.*` client resource ships with `verifyHogsendWebhook` (svix +
  node:crypto fallback), and the CLI gains a `hogsend webhooks` command.

  Adds inbound integration presets (Clerk, Supabase `auth.users`, Stripe,
  Segment) as `defineWebhookSource` presets, enabled by env. The webhook-source
  auth contract is widened to a discriminated union with a fail-closed
  `signature` scheme (svix / Stripe `node:crypto` / generic HMAC-hex), and the
  route reads the raw body once so signatures verify against the exact bytes.

  All engine-line packages move together on the version line so the scaffold's
  caret pins keep resolving.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Front door: public data-plane API + client SDK.

  Adds the public `/v1` data plane — `contacts` (upsert/find/delete), `events`,
  `emails` (transactional), `lists`, and `campaigns` (broadcast to a list or
  bucket) — behind an API key with a new orthogonal `ingest` scope, plus the new
  `@hogsend/client` SDK. Identity gains email/anonymous keys with a real
  merge/alias resolver (anonymous→identified). Lists are code-defined over the
  existing preference store; campaigns are durable, idempotent, preference-checked
  broadcasts. The CLI moves onto the engine version line and gains write commands.

  The unauthenticated `POST /v1/ingest` is removed — use `POST /v1/events`.
  Event properties no longer merge onto the contact: `contactProperties` write to
  the contact, `eventProperties` to the event (trigger/exit conditions).

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- cd86e13: Bucket lifecycle: colocated reactions + member access on `defineBucket`

  - Typed transition refs `bucket.entered` / `bucket.left` (literal-typed off the
    bucket's own id) usable directly as journey `trigger` / `exitOn` values.
  - Colocated reactions `bucket.on("enter" | "leave" | "dwell", opts?, handler)`
    that desugar to tagged durable journeys with the full `JourneyContext`.
  - `dwell` reactions driven by the reconcile cron over the existing active
    population, with a historical `dwellAnchorAt` derived during backfill so dwell
    fires for the genuinely long-dwelling population on first deploy.
  - Member access `bucket.count()` / `has()` / `members()` / `membersIterator()`.
  - Studio groups generated reactions under their bucket via `sourceBucketId`.

  Deprecates (kept for one release) the hand-maintained `BucketId` union and the
  `bucketEntered` / `bucketLeft` string helpers in favour of the typed refs. The
  scaffold drops the re-widening `DefinedBucket[]` annotation so literal ids infer.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- f4e604e: Version-line alignment — no functional changes. Bumped to keep all
  scaffold-pinned packages on the engine `0.5.x` minor line so the caret-pinned
  (`^{{ENGINE_VERSION}}`) `create-hogsend` template resolves every `@hogsend/*`
  dependency. (`@hogsend/email` also picks up a README refresh documenting that the
  `EmailProvider` contract now lives in `@hogsend/core`.)

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0db58c6: Align the scaffold-pinned packages to the engine 0.4 line (no functional changes) so a fresh `create-hogsend` install resolves every `@hogsend/*` dependency on one compatible minor. Remember to bump `ENGINE_VERSION` in `packages/create-hogsend/src/template-manifest.ts` to match in the Version PR.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 31e5ed7: Add Buckets — first-class, code-defined segments with real-time membership

  `defineBucket()` introduces named membership groups as a peer primitive to
  journeys. A user joins a bucket the moment their data satisfies its criteria and
  leaves when it stops; each transition emits `bucket:entered` / `bucket:left`
  (plus per-bucket aliases `bucket:entered:<id>` / `bucket:left:<id>`) through the
  ingest pipeline, so a bucket join/leave can trigger a journey via the journey's
  `trigger.event` (Hatchet `onEvents`). Criteria reuse the existing `@hogsend/core`
  condition engine.

  - `@hogsend/core` — `BucketMeta`, `bucketMetaSchema`, and `BucketRegistry`
    (event/property indexes for candidate narrowing).
  - `@hogsend/db` — `bucket_memberships` (re-entry-safe partial unique active
    index) and `bucket_configs` tables on the engine migration track.
  - `@hogsend/engine` — `defineBucket`, real-time inclusion/exclusion evaluation
    inside the ingest pipeline (recursion-guarded, transition-only emission), an
    engine-owned cron reconciliation for time-based/absence leaves, opt-in
    fast-expiry timers, an unconditional `maxDwell` membership TTL (force-leave N
    after joining regardless of criteria; re-entry governed by `reentry`), backfill
    - criteria-change re-evaluation, admin routes (`/v1/admin/buckets`), an optional
      off-by-default PostHog person-property sync, and `buckets` / `ENABLED_BUCKETS`
      wiring on `createHogsendClient` and `createWorker`.
  - `@hogsend/studio` — an observe-only Buckets view (size, enter/leave over time,
    which journeys a bucket feeds).
  - `create-hogsend` — the scaffold template ships a `src/buckets/` example and the
    client/worker wiring.

  All changes are additive; existing journeys, the engine factories, and consumer
  types are unaffected. Consumers pick up a new engine-track migration applied by
  the standard pre-deploy `db:migrate`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 94a0bd4: Timezone-aware scheduling, send windows, and per-recipient frequency capping.

  - **`createHogsendClient({ defaults })`** — new `defaults.timezone` (global fallback IANA tz), `defaults.sendWindow` (quiet-hours window auto-applied by `ctx.when`), and `defaults.frequencyCap` (per-recipient send cap enforced in the mailer; "transactional" exempt by default).
  - **`ctx.when(...)`** on the journey context — resolves a send instant in the recipient's timezone and snaps it inside the configured send window.
  - **Timezone resolution** — new `resolveTimezone` / `resolveTimezoneWithSource` / `setContactTimezone` (`@hogsend/engine`) with a precedence chain (explicit → PostHog person props → `contacts.timezone` cache → global default), plus explicit-tz validation.
  - **`@hogsend/core/schedule`** — new public schedule module (window/time/tz resolvers).
  - **`isFrequencyCapped`** + `FrequencyCapConfig` / `FrequencyCapWindow` exports.

  Includes additive migration `0009` (expand-only): a nullable `contacts.timezone` column and an `email_sends` frequency-cap index. **After upgrading, run `db:migrate`** — the boot guard reports `schema.engine.inSync` until applied. No backfill required (the tz column is an opportunistic cache below PostHog/properties in precedence).
