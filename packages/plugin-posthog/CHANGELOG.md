# @hogsend/plugin-posthog

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e2e254c: feat: outbound webhooks + integration presets

  Adds a Svix-style HMAC-signed outbound webhook stream — a 12-event catalog,
  managed endpoints (`/v1/admin/webhooks` CRUD + rotate-secret + test), and
  durable delivery (per-endpoint retry/backoff, dead-letter, and a 1-minute
  reaper that re-drives due retries and recovers orphaned `sending` rows). The
  `hs.webhooks.*` client resource ships with `verifyHogsendWebhook` (svix +
  node:crypto fallback), and the CLI gains a `hogsend webhooks` command.

  Adds inbound integration presets (Clerk, Supabase `auth.users`, Stripe,
  Segment) as `defineWebhookSource` presets, enabled by env. The webhook-source
  auth contract is widened to a discriminated union with a fail-closed
  `signature` scheme (svix / Stripe `node:crypto` / generic HMAC-hex), and the
  route reads the raw body once so signatures verify against the exact bytes.

  All engine-line packages move together on the version line so the scaffold's
  caret pins keep resolving.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [e2e254c]
  - @hogsend/core@0.8.0

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Front door: public data-plane API + client SDK.

  Adds the public `/v1` data plane — `contacts` (upsert/find/delete), `events`,
  `emails` (transactional), `lists`, and `campaigns` (broadcast to a list or
  bucket) — behind an API key with a new orthogonal `ingest` scope, plus the new
  `@hogsend/client` SDK. Identity gains email/anonymous keys with a real
  merge/alias resolver (anonymous→identified). Lists are code-defined over the
  existing preference store; campaigns are durable, idempotent, preference-checked
  broadcasts. The CLI moves onto the engine version line and gains write commands.

  The unauthenticated `POST /v1/ingest` is removed — use `POST /v1/events`.
  Event properties no longer merge onto the contact: `contactProperties` write to
  the contact, `eventProperties` to the event (trigger/exit conditions).

### Patch Changes

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- cd86e13: Bucket lifecycle: colocated reactions + member access on `defineBucket`

  - Typed transition refs `bucket.entered` / `bucket.left` (literal-typed off the
    bucket's own id) usable directly as journey `trigger` / `exitOn` values.
  - Colocated reactions `bucket.on("enter" | "leave" | "dwell", opts?, handler)`
    that desugar to tagged durable journeys with the full `JourneyContext`.
  - `dwell` reactions driven by the reconcile cron over the existing active
    population, with a historical `dwellAnchorAt` derived during backfill so dwell
    fires for the genuinely long-dwelling population on first deploy.
  - Member access `bucket.count()` / `has()` / `members()` / `membersIterator()`.
  - Studio groups generated reactions under their bucket via `sourceBucketId`.

  Deprecates (kept for one release) the hand-maintained `BucketId` union and the
  `bucketEntered` / `bucketLeft` string helpers in favour of the typed refs. The
  scaffold drops the re-widening `DefinedBucket[]` annotation so literal ids infer.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [cd86e13]
  - @hogsend/core@0.6.0

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- f4e604e: Relocate the capability-provider contracts to `@hogsend/core`. The `EmailProvider`
  and `PostHogService` interfaces (and their supporting types — `SendEmailOptions`,
  `BatchEmailItem`, `SendResult`, `WebhookEvent`, `WebhookEventType`,
  `WebhookHandlerMap`, `CaptureOptions`) now live in `@hogsend/core` and are
  re-exported from `@hogsend/engine` as the canonical author import. The vendor
  plugins (`@hogsend/plugin-resend`, `@hogsend/plugin-posthog`) re-export them
  unchanged, so existing imports keep working — no breaking changes. A custom email
  provider now implements `import type { EmailProvider } from "@hogsend/engine"`
  (the contract no longer lives inside the Resend package). See
  `docs/adr/0001-provider-boundary.md`.

  Also makes the injected provider/analytics instances load-bearing: a swapped
  `opts.analytics` is now honored in journey context, the bucket→PostHog sync, and
  worker shutdown (previously these bypassed it via the module singleton), and the
  built-in `send-email` task and alert notifications now deliver through the
  injected `EmailProvider` instead of constructing a raw Resend client — so a
  swapped provider takes effect everywhere. The `send-email` task no longer
  double-retries on top of the provider's own retry loop.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [f4e604e]
  - @hogsend/core@0.5.0

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0db58c6: Align the scaffold-pinned packages to the engine 0.4 line (no functional changes) so a fresh `create-hogsend` install resolves every `@hogsend/*` dependency on one compatible minor. Remember to bump `ENGINE_VERSION` in `packages/create-hogsend/src/template-manifest.ts` to match in the Version PR.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 3601a18: Align the supporting packages to the 0.1.0 release line. A scaffolded app pins every `@hogsend/*` dependency to a single exact version token, so all published packages must share one version line. These three lagged at 0.0.1 while the engine line moved to 0.1.0, which would leave a fresh scaffold unable to resolve its dependencies.
