## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- bbc37e7: Provider-neutral analytics: the `AnalyticsProvider` contract (the analytics
  sibling of `EmailProvider`, authored via `defineAnalyticsProvider`) lands in
  `@hogsend/core`, with person reads (`getPersonProperties`), person writes
  (`setPersonProperties` — `set`/`setOnce`/`unset`), and capture.
  `createHogsendClient`'s `analytics` option now mirrors `email`
  (`{ provider?, providers?, defaultProvider? }`, env preset + consumer-last,
  `ANALYTICS_PROVIDER` selection); legacy `PostHogService` inputs are
  adapter-wrapped and keep working. `client.analyticsProviders` is the registry,
  `client.analytics` the resolved active provider.

  PostHog person reads are FIXED — they were silently dead (the write-only
  `phc_` project key sent to the ingestion host at a legacy path). Reads now use
  `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY` (a personal API key scoped `person:read`) against
  the private API host (derived from `POSTHOG_HOST`, override
  `POSTHOG_PRIVATE_HOST`) with one-shot project-id discovery (override
  `POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID`). Without the personal key, reads soft-fail to contact
  property fallbacks — now surfaced once at boot and by `hogsend doctor`
  instead of silently. Person WRITES need no extra credential (they ride the
  capture pipeline as `$set`/`$set_once`/`$unset`); `createPostHogProvider` is
  the reference implementation. The scaffold's `env.example` documents the
  two-credential model. (The full engine line rides together per release
  discipline.)

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 6434a65: Close the analytics identity loop: `POST /v1/events` now returns `contactKey` —
  the contact's canonical key (`external_id ?? anonymous_id ?? id`), the same key
  outbound destinations emit as `userId` and `hs_t` identity tokens resolve to —
  so a consumer site can `identify()` its analytics session against the contact
  without any PII round-trip.

  To make that key safe to circulate, identity resolution now round-trips it:
  `findByKey` falls back to the contact row id for external-kind lookups (an
  email-only contact's canonical key IS its row id), and a merge records the
  email-only loser's row-id key as an external alias — so a key that left the
  system (Hatchet payloads, destination `userId`s, `hs_t` stitches, forwarded
  PostHog webhooks) always resolves back to the same live contact instead of
  minting a duplicate. (The full engine line rides together per release
  discipline.)

## 0.17.1

### Patch Changes

- e459fb5: Fix the Studio password-reset link landing on the login card instead of the reset form. The engine's bare `/studio` → `/studio/` redirect dropped the query string, losing better-auth's `?token=…`; the redirect now preserves it, and the Studio's reset redirect targets `/studio/` directly so the link skips the hop entirely. (The full engine line rides together per release discipline.)

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- a3e15c4: Keep the engine version line uniform for the Studio crimzon design-system release — all engine-line packages move to the same minor together, and the scaffold republishes with the matching `ENGINE_VERSION` pins.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 5fdd9fa: Semantic links follow-ups: the hosted answer page and cross-device identity.

  **Hosted answer page** — a semantic link with no landing page of its own can
  point at the engine: `href={HOSTED_ANSWER_HREF}` (new in `@hogsend/email`)
  resolves at send time to `GET /v1/t/a/:linkId`, a minimal engine-served page
  that confirms the recorded answer and offers a free-text box. Submissions
  ingest as `<event>.comment` (one per send + event, `semc:` idempotency key) —
  a real consumer event journeys can wait on and destinations receive. The
  scaffold's `feedback-checkin` example now lands there by default.

  **Cross-device identity (`hs_t`)** — opt-in via `TRACKING_IDENTITY_TOKEN=true`:
  tracked-link redirects append a one-hour identity token to the destination
  URL; the landing site exchanges it at the new `POST /v1/t/identify` for the
  distinct id and calls `posthog.identify`, merging the email click with the
  web session. Tokens are AES-256-GCM **encrypted** with `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
  (a distinct id can be an email address — nothing readable travels in a URL,
  history entry, or referrer). New exports: `generateIdentityToken`,
  `validateIdentityToken`, `InvalidIdentityTokenError`.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- ee3b670: Journey `where` builder — code-first trigger/exit conditions.

  `trigger.where` and `exitOn[].where` now accept a builder function alongside
  the declarative array, mirroring bucket criteria:

  ```ts
  trigger: {
    event: "nps.detractor",
    where: (b) => b.prop("score").lte(3),
  },
  ```

  The function resolves ONCE at `defineJourney` time (via the existing
  `criteriaBuilder`) into the byte-identical `PropertyCondition[]` POJOs, so the
  stored `JourneyMeta`, registry zod parse, `checkExits`, admin routes, and
  Studio all keep seeing plain data. Return a single condition or an array
  (AND-ed). New types: `JourneyMetaInput`, `JourneyWhere`, `JourneyWhereBuilder`
  in `@hogsend/core`. Fully backward compatible — the array form is unchanged
  and remains the wire/HTTP format.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- b644a01: Semantic email links — in-email surveys, actions & enrichment.

  `EmailAction` (new in `@hogsend/email`) renders an anchor whose click MEANS
  something: it carries an event name + scalar properties that the engine lifts
  into `tracked_links` at send time (the attributes never reach the inbox) and
  emits through the full ingest pipeline at click time. In-email yes/no
  questions, NPS scores, and one-tap choices become real events that route to
  journeys, persist to `user_events`, and fan out to destinations as the new
  `email.action` outbound type (the PostHog preset captures it under the
  consumer's event name).

  - First answer wins per (send, event name) via a `sem:` idempotency key.
    Answers are confirmed by a deferred task after a ~30s window, so scanner
    click-bursts (SafeLinks/Proofpoint) are judged with the WHOLE burst visible
    — including the scanner's first click — before any answer is recorded.
  - `ctx.waitForEvent` now returns `{ timedOut, properties? }` — the matched
    event's payload, so journeys branch on the answer directly (additive,
    backward compatible) — and accepts an optional `lookback` window that checks
    recent `user_events` first, closing the gap where an answer lands between a
    send (or a previous wait) and the wait being established.
  - `tracked_links` gains nullable `event`, `event_properties`,
    `semantic_emitted_at` columns (expand-only migration 0023). Same-URL links
    carrying different answers no longer collapse into one row.
  - Reserved event namespaces (`email.`/`journey.`/`bucket.`/`contact.`) are
    rejected at send time; semantic properties are scalars-only, size-capped.
  - Outbound catalog grows to 14 events (`email.action`) — engine, CLI mirror,
    and client mirror updated. Seeded PostHog destinations subscribe to it, and
    an existing engine-seeded endpoint is reconciled (missing funnel events
    unioned in) at boot. A failed Hatchet publish now rolls back the
    idempotency claim inside `ingestEvent`, so a transient broker error can't
    permanently consume an answer slot.
  - Scaffold ships a `feedback-checkin` example (semantic yes/no email + journey
    reacting via `waitForEvent` properties).

### Patch Changes

- f6ae542: Claim the bare `hogsend` npm name: a new alias package whose bin forwards to `@hogsend/cli`, so `npx hogsend` / `pnpm dlx hogsend upgrade` work without the scope. `@hogsend/cli` now exports `./bin` (and `./package.json`) to support it.
