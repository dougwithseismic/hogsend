### Patch Changes

- 3853800: fix(engine): provenance-pin engine-internal re-ingests so a contact's own canonical key never mints a phantom identified twin

  A server-side re-ingest keyed by `userId = <a contact's canonical key>` (which for an anonymous — or email+anon — contact IS its `anonymous_id`) was resolved through the value path, which only matches `external_id`, so it minted a second "identified" contact `{ external_id: <anonId> }`. That phantom twin then tripped the in-app feed's `collidesWithIdentified` guard, 403-ing the visitor out of their OWN feed (`anonymousId is not addressable`). The most direct trigger was the feed's own mark-read / mark-all re-ingests.

  Fix: engine-internal re-emit sites now carry the subject's unforgeable contact row id (`contactId`) and the resolver pins to that exact row (`resolveByContactId`, `FOR UPDATE`, follows merge-aliases to the survivor) — never value-resolving, never minting. The public `/v1/events`/`/v1/feed` routes cannot supply `contactId` (schemas omit it, handlers build the resolve literally, and it's mutually exclusive with the publishable clamp), so the anti-impersonation boundary is unchanged and `collidesWithIdentified` stays strict. Threaded through `ingestEvent` + the feed mark/clear re-ingests; genuine external identities (no `contactId`) take the unchanged value path.

## 0.36.0

### Minor Changes

- 02dab59: Client-side layer: `@hogsend/js` (zero-dependency browser core — identity, capture, preferences, in-app feed, banners, toasts, reactive store) and `@hogsend/react` (provider, hooks, and the `NotificationBell`/`FeedPopover`/`NotificationFeed`/`Banner`/`Toast` components with a `--hs-*` themed override surface), plus the engine pieces that power them:

  - Publishable-key (`pk_`) browser-ingest auth (`requirePublishableOrIngest`, per-key origin allowlist, `allowed_origins` migration, reflective CORS, `GET /v1/lists/preferences`).
  - The in-app feed backend: `feed_items` table, `sendFeedItem()` + `send-feed` workflow, recipient-scoped `/v1/feed/*` routes with SSE fan-out.
  - `sendBanner()` on the feed primitive, and the server-side `generateUserToken` mint helper for identified browser sessions.

  Every client interaction is a first-party `inapp.*`/`banner.*` event through the ingest spine, so it can trigger a journey and fan to PostHog. `@hogsend/js` and `@hogsend/react` ride the engine version line but are opt-in (not `create-hogsend` scaffold defaults).

### Patch Changes

- afbfa22: Fix scaffolded apps crashing at boot ("Dynamic require of X is not supported") on engine 0.35.0+

  engine 0.35.0 added `ai` + `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider` (for the Studio agent), but the `create-hogsend` template's `package.json` never declared them — so a consumer's tsup (which externalizes everything outside `@hogsend/*`) had no node_modules copy to externalize and instead bundled the CJS `ai` tree (transitively `@vercel/oidc`) into the ESM `dist`, which crashes at module-eval. The template now declares `ai`, `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider`, plus the two other engine runtime deps that were also missing (`svix`, `picocolors`), so tsup externalizes them and they resolve from node_modules at runtime. `verify-scaffold` now boots the built app (api + worker) to catch this class of bundling regression, which a build-only smoke missed.

### Minor Changes

- d510956: Studio co-working AI agent (GLM-5.2 via OpenRouter)

  Adds an in-Studio co-working agent: a bottom-right chat panel that reads the live
  instance (contacts, events, journeys, buckets, sends) and can act through the
  existing data plane — every write gated behind a human-in-the-loop confirmation.

  - Engine: streaming `POST /v1/admin/agent/chat` (Vercel AI SDK + OpenRouter,
    default model `z-ai/glm-5.2`) under the admin auth/rate-limit/audit stack; the
    OpenRouter key never leaves the server. Read tools auto-run; write tools mint a
    single-use, encrypted, Redis-burned proposal token that only
    `POST /v1/admin/agent/confirm` can execute (idempotent, audited,
    test-mode-aware tier reclassification).
  - Studio: launcher → slide-over drawer, multi-chat (localStorage), markdown
    rendering, tool-call cards, a tier-driven confirmation card, and per-message
    edit / rollback / regenerate over a virtualized thread.

  Opt-in and fail-closed: with no `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` the panel shows a calm
  "not configured" state and the routes 503. The rest of the engine-line packages
  move with the engine version line (no functional change in those).

### Minor Changes

- 7abff9e: feat(engine): fan ingested events out to PostHog + fix Discord identity direction

  Mirror every ingested event into the active analytics provider from the ingest
  spine, keyed to the resolved canonical contact key. Opt-in via
  `analytics.eventMirror` (or the `ANALYTICS_EVENT_MIRROR` env override), default
  off. Excludes `source: "posthog"` events (echo-loop guard) and supports
  `allow`/`deny` event-name filters. Fires once on the fresh-insert side of the
  ingest idempotency guard, so retries never double-capture and journeys never
  call it.

  Discord inbound transforms no longer mint `userId: "discord:<id>"` — a pre-link
  member is anonymous (keyed by the `discord_id` column), so a later `/link`
  merges it into the email/web contact in the correct direction (`$create_alias`
  folds the Discord person onto the canonical one). Each inbound event now carries
  the actor's own snowflake in its properties (`authorId` / `reactorId` /
  `memberId`), so role grants and DMs fire for members who have not linked yet.

  Widen the connector-action contact resolver to also match `anonymous_id` and the
  uuid `id` column (uuid-shape-gated to avoid an invalid-uuid cast), so
  `member: user.id` resolves any canonical-key form for outbound actions.

### Minor Changes

- 855b3e4: feat(plugin-discord): `removeRole` outbound action for tenure ladders.

  Adds a `removeRole` action mirroring `grantRole` (bot-REST `DELETE
.../roles/{roleId}`, idempotent, soft-fails on an unresolved member or a
  permission/hierarchy 403) so journeys can demote as well as promote — e.g. a
  Stranger → Piglet → Hog member lifecycle (drop Stranger on `/link`, drop Piglet
  on graduating to Hog after a 7-day tenure + a message). The rest of the engine
  line rides the version bump.

### Patch Changes

- 51afd44: fix(engine): preserve Hatchet `this` binding in the journey side-effect memoize.

  `createMemoize` extracted Hatchet's `memo` into a variable and called it unbound
  (`const memo = ctx.memo; memo(fn, deps)`). The SDK's `memo` body opens with
  `this.throwIfCancelled()` and reads other `this`-bound fields, so the unbound
  call threw `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'throwIfCancelled')` —
  crashing EVERY journey side effect (`sendEmail` / `sendConnectorAction` /
  `ctx.trigger`) the moment an eviction-capable engine (hatchet-lite ≥ v0.80.0)
  made `supportsEviction === true`. Tests stub `memo` as a plain arrow fn and CI's
  hatchet-lite reports `supportsEviction: false`, so the buggy path was never
  exercised. Fixed by invoking `ctx.memo(fn, deps)` directly; added a regression
  test whose stub `memo` is a method that touches `this`.

## 0.32.0

### Minor Changes

- 8c672dc: Managed-link campaigns + connector engagement events.

  `link.clicked` is now a first-party bus event: a click on any NON-email managed
  link (Discord, SMS, referral, standalone Studio link) re-ingests through the
  journey pipeline, so a journey can `trigger` on — or `ctx.waitForEvent` for — a
  click of a SPECIFIC managed link (filter by `linkId`/`campaign`). The re-ingest
  is gated on `!isBot` (unfurl/prefetch bots that auto-fetch DM'd links are
  suppressed) and a personal link's `distinctId` (broadcast/public links carry no
  person). The per-hit outbound `link.clicked` webhook and the entire email
  branch are unchanged.

  `ctx.waitForEvent` gains an optional `where` predicate (the same model as
  `trigger.where`) so a journey can await a specific link's click mid-run. It runs
  an engine-side durable re-arm loop with a persisted `wait_deadline` (survives
  Hatchet replay), gap-proof re-scans, and scalar-narrowed properties; omitting
  `where` keeps the exact legacy single-wait. `ctx.history.events` gains an
  `event` name filter.

  Connector engagement events: the connector transform contract widens to
  `IngestEvent | IngestEvent[] | null`, and Discord reactions now fan out into a
  reactor-keyed `discord.reaction_added` (carrying the target author for
  distinct-people counting) plus, when the message author is known (resolved
  cache-only in the gateway worker — no REST), an author-keyed
  `discord.reaction_received` powering "your post resonated with N people". Adds
  `discord.reaction_removed` and a `grantRole` outbound action for the
  community-gamification loop (count an engagement event → grant a role + DM).

### Patch Changes

- 092cc7c: create-hogsend: finish the onboarding hand-off — Studio, Discord, and docs, not just Hatchet.

  Once a scaffold (and `bootstrap`) finishes, the "what now" now leads with the three
  touchpoints that matter — the Studio dashboard (`http://localhost:3002/studio`), the
  Discord invite (`discord.gg/rv6eZNvYrr`), and the docs — instead of dropping the user
  at the Hatchet dashboard. The bootstrap summary also states plainly that local infra
  is up but the app itself is NOT running yet: the compose stack is only Postgres + Redis

  - Hatchet, while the API and worker are your code, started with `dev` + `worker:dev`.
    A closing "Welcome to Hogsend" bookends the scaffolder's opening note.

  Two fixes ride along:

  - The CLI's git-init and dependency-install now run as async `spawn` instead of the
    blocking `spawnSync`. A clack spinner animates on a `setInterval`, and `spawnSync`
    froze the event loop for the whole (often 30s+) install — so the spinner sat dead on
    one frame and read as "is this stuck?". `spawn` keeps the loop free so it actually
    spins.
  - The engine dev banner pointed Studio at a Vite `:5173` origin that only exists in
    the monorepo, so a scaffolded `pnpm dev` showed a link that 404'd. It now points at
    the API's own `${url}/studio`, where the Studio SPA is actually served, and adds the
    Discord link.

  The rest of the `@hogsend/*` line moves with this patch to stay on a single engine
  version line.

- e7583f3: Journeys: exactly-once side effects across a Hatchet durable replay.

  Journey `run()` bodies call `sendEmail()`, `ctx.trigger()`, and `sendConnectorAction()` inline between durable waits. Hatchet replays a durable task from the top on worker crash, OOM, or redeploy, so these previously re-fired and could deliver duplicate emails / events / connector messages.

  Side effects are now exactly-once with **no journey-authoring change in the common case**. An `AsyncLocalStorage` journey boundary auto-derives a deterministic, branch-stable idempotency key (`workflowRunId : nearest-wait-label : discriminant`) and threads it through the existing `email_sends` / `user_events` unique-index short-circuits, plus a new `connector_deliveries` table (migration `0031`) for Telegram/Discord sends. A Hatchet `memo()` fast path skips the effect entirely before the DB on eviction-capable engines (>= v0.80.0). The one authoring rule (enforced by a loud throw on an intra-run key collision): pass a distinct `idempotencyLabel` when sending the same template, triggering the same event, or running the same connector action more than once in one journey on divergent branches. Adds `ctx.now()` (replay-stable clock) and `ctx.once()` (record-once per enrollment).

  The rest of the `@hogsend/*` line moves with this patch to stay on a single engine version line.

- ea4d9d0: Studio: Debug is now a global drawer with a typed (scalar) property builder.

  Firing a test event no longer means navigating to a `/debug` page. A **Fire event**
  button in the header (and the Overview getting-started CTA) opens a slide-out drawer
  from anywhere in Studio, so you can trigger a journey without leaving the page you're
  on. The `/debug` route, its sidebar item, and the old page are removed.

  The drawer also replaces the raw-JSON properties textarea with a **typed scalar
  editor**: each property is a key + a type (string / number / boolean) + a value, so
  the test event exercises `POST /v1/admin/events` with the same scalar types real code
  sends. Numbers that don't parse to a finite value fail loudly (no silent `NaN`/`null`),
  and a duplicate key is rejected rather than silently overwritten.

  The rest of the `@hogsend/*` line moves with this patch to stay on a single engine
  version line.

- ce700ae: Studio: an Events feed with source provenance + person drill-in, and event provenance on every ingested event.

  Studio gains an **Events** view — a filterable, paginated feed of every event ingested
  into the pipeline (`Event · Source · Person · Properties · Time`), with a **Live**
  auto-refresh toggle. Clicking an event opens its properties as **typed key/value rows**
  (string/number/boolean/null type chips); clicking the **person** opens the full contact
  drawer (properties + email activity + a timeline of their other events). The contact
  drawer also now renders the contact's **properties** (previously fetched but hidden).

  To make "where did this event come from?" answerable, events now carry a **source**.
  A new nullable `user_events.source` column (migration `0030`) is stamped at every
  ingestion entry point: webhook sources record their id (so PostHog → `posthog`, Stripe
  → `stripe`, …), the public data-plane API → `api`, the Studio Debug panel + admin
  enroll → `studio`, connectors → `connector`, journey triggers → `journey`, plus
  `bucket` / `tracking` / `import`. The Events feed shows + filters by it.

  The admin events list endpoint LEFT JOINs the live contact (matching the resolved key
  across `externalId` / `anonymousId` / `id`) so each event carries its person's email +
  contact id, and accepts a `source` filter. Pre-existing events have `source = null`.

  The rest of the `@hogsend/*` line moves with this patch to stay on a single engine
  version line.

- 32d9875: Studio: per-journey detail pages.

  Journeys in Studio were a single list with an inline funnel — there was no way to
  drill into one. Clicking a journey now opens a dedicated `/journeys/:id` page:

  - **Definition** — trigger event + `where` conditions, `exitOn` rules, `entryLimit`,
    and the `suppress` window.
  - **Funnel** — the existing enrolled → sent → opened → clicked → completed funnel.
  - **Email** — the templates the journey has actually sent, with sent/opened/clicked
    counts and an inline rendered preview (reusing the template-preview iframe). Scoped
    to email; other channels (Discord/Telegram) aren't shown.
  - **Instances** — a filterable, paginated browser of `journey_states`; each row opens
    a slide-out drawer with the instance's transition log and enrollment context.

  Backed by a new `GET /v1/admin/journeys/:id/templates` endpoint (distinct templates
  sent within the journey, derived from `email_sends` joined through `journey_states`).
  `StatusBadge` also gained journey-instance statuses (active/waiting/completed/exited)
  so they're visually distinguishable.

  The rest of the `@hogsend/*` line moves with this patch to stay on a single engine
  version line.

- 28e14de: Studio: a non-blocking setup checklist, and stop the domain page erroring without a Resend key.

  Opening Studio with no (or a send-only) email provider key made `GET /v1/admin/domain`
  return a 502 — "domains request to provider resend failed: … API key is invalid" — which
  the Setup view rendered as a scary error. A permission-denied (401/403) from the provider's
  domains API is a CONFIGURATION state, not a server error, so it now degrades gracefully:
  the domain status service catches it, engages the same warn-once + back-off the per-send
  path already uses, and returns a `200` with `status: null`. Transient failures (network/5xx)
  still surface as `502`.

  On top of that, a new `GET /v1/admin/readiness` endpoint reports per-area setup state
  (Studio admin, Hatchet, email provider key, data-plane API key, sending domain, PostHog) as
  `ok` / `action` / `optional`, and the Studio Setup page renders it as a non-blocking
  checklist above the sending-domain section. Nothing gates the UI: while it loads it shows a
  skeleton, and any probe failure degrades a single row rather than the page.

  The rest of the `@hogsend/*` line moves with this patch to stay on a single engine version
  line.

### Patch Changes

- 79bb505: create-hogsend: repair the pnpm/yarn admin-create crash + onboarding UX pass.

  The scaffold's Studio-admin step (and the `studio:admin` package.json script) ran
  `node node_modules/.bin/hogsend …`, but under pnpm/yarn that bin is a POSIX shell
  shim — pointing `node` at it parsed shell as JavaScript and crashed with
  `SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list`. Both call sites now target the CLI's
  real ESM entry `node_modules/@hogsend/cli/dist/bin.js`, which resolves identically
  on npm/pnpm/yarn/bun. Plus a UX pass on the creator: a welcome banner, a
  dependency-free spinner on the silent Hatchet-token wait, and `hogsend connect
posthog` surfaced as a guided post-deploy step (shown even when PostHog is chosen
  without a pasted key).

  The rest of the `@hogsend/*` line moves with this patch to stay on a single
  engine version line (no code changes outside create-hogsend).

### Minor Changes

- 8422893: Restyle the cold-connect confirmation page + realign the scaffolder to the engine line.

  - **`@hogsend/engine`** — the engine-served cold-connect connect page (`GET /connect/<connector>`) is restyled to the Hogsend Studio "Crimzon" design language (ink surface, hairline-bordered card, Inter, eyebrow label, faint grain). New optional `ColdConnectBranding` fields — `iconSvg` (inline platform-logo SVG, shape-checked and fail-closed to the emoji badge), `eyebrow`, and `reassurance` (an "if this wasn't you, ignore this" footnote). Hardening: branding JSON embedded in the page's inline `<script>` is escaped against a `</script>` breakout, the page clears WCAG AA contrast, and it no longer pulls a third-party webfont.
  - **`@hogsend/plugin-telegram`** — the Telegram cold-connect branding now ships the real Telegram paper-plane logo + the reassurance copy, and its accent is darkened to `#1f6feb` so the white Confirm-button label clears WCAG AA.
  - **`create-hogsend`** — realigned to the engine version line. It had silently drifted to `0.22.0` on npm (8 minors behind) because it sits outside the `@hogsend/*` scope the release gate enforces uniformity on, so `create-hogsend@latest` scaffolded a stale app. `release-doctor` now asserts the scaffolder tracks the engine version so this can't recur.

  The remaining engine-line packages are version-only bumps to keep the engine release line uniform.

### Minor Changes

- e5f720e: feat(plugin-discord): adopt the cold-connect link-confirm flow (drop the typed-code /verify)

  Refactors `@hogsend/plugin-discord` onto the engine `createColdConnect()` primitive so Discord linking matches Telegram: `/link <email>` → emailed one-click confirm LINK → click → the engine-served connect page binds `discord_id` + email onto one contact + client-identifies. **`/verify` and the typed-code path are removed.**

  - **`@hogsend/plugin-discord`** — `InteractionDeps` is reworked (breaking): the code-flow callbacks (`mintCode`, `sendLinkCode`, `redeemCode`, `recordVerifyAttempt`) are dropped in favour of a single consumer-supplied **`requestConfirm({ discordUserId, email }) → { ok } | { ok: false, reason }`** that mints a server-sealed cold-connect token and emails the confirm link (the token never reaches the handler). The Enter-code component/modal, the `/verify` slash command, and the `CODE_MODAL`/`ENTER_CODE_BUTTON` custom-ids are deleted; `CustomIds` is now just `{ EMAIL_MODAL }`. The mint throttle moved entirely into `mintConfirm` (Redis-INCR, fail-closed). New export: `RequestConfirmResult`.
  - **`member_link` OAuth path is preserved** — its `resolveContact` (which runs `linkContact` + role-grant + the `discord.linked` emit for the operator/known-contact web-bind) is kept and is used ONLY by the OAuth branch, not the `/link` interactions path. Both bind paths stay at parity: `/link` grants the role via the cold-connect `afterBind` + emits via the exchange's `ingestEvent`; the OAuth branch keeps doing it via `resolveContact`.
  - **`apps/api`** is the in-monorepo reference consumer: it constructs `discordColdConnect = createColdConnect({ identityKind: "discordId", platformKey: id => id, buildIngest: scalar discordId, … })`, wires `requestConfirm` to `mintConfirm` + the transactional confirm email, and mounts the routes via the array form of `CreateAppOptions.routes`. The now-orphaned `transactional/discord-link-code` template is removed.

  The remaining engine-line packages are version-only bumps to keep the engine release line uniform.

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- bbfd270: feat(engine): createColdConnect() — a reusable cold-connect primitive (generalizes the Telegram email-link flow)

  Extracts the Telegram cold-connect flow (`/link <email>` → emailed confirm link → click → server-sealed bind → client-side `posthog.identify`) into a channel-agnostic engine primitive so Discord, Telegram, and future connectors share one mechanism.

  - **`@hogsend/engine`**: new `createColdConnect({ connectorId, identityKind, platformKey, linkedEvent, identifyPropKey, buildIngest, branding, ttlSeconds?, throttle?, afterBind? })` → `{ mintConfirm, confirmUrl, routes }`. The factory owns the sealed-token store (Redis, `connectorId` sealed in the value), the connect page, and the `peek → ingestEvent → consume` exchange. Security invariants baked in: the bind runs only on a human POST (never a GET prefetch); the exchange body is `{tok}`-only (ids come solely from the sealed token — no graft); single-use peek-then-consume (a webhook/retry can't burn the link), and the token is consumed even if `afterBind` throws (at-least-once, idempotent-required); a fail-closed Redis-INCR mint throttle; cross-connector token isolation (basePath + idempotency key + a `binding.connectorId === connectorId` assert, 410 on mismatch). The exchange uses `ingestEvent` (folds the platform key + email onto one contact and routes the welcome journey) and returns the canonical `contactKey`, which the page hands to `posthog.identify` — keyed to the server-proven id, never a client-supplied one.
  - **`CreateAppOptions.routes`** now accepts a single fn **or an array** of route fns, so a consumer can mount `[existingRoutes, coldConnect.routes]` without clobbering.
  - **`@hogsend/plugin-telegram`**: refactored onto the primitive (`telegramColdConnect = createColdConnect(...)`); the bespoke `telegram-connect.ts` page/exchange and the confirm-token family in `link.ts` are removed (the `/start` deep-link path stays). The connect basePath is unchanged (`/connect/telegram`), so confirmation emails in flight keep resolving.
  - **`apps/docs`**: the marketing PostHog init now sets `cross_subdomain_cookie: true` so a **consented** visitor's distinct_id is written to a `.hogsend.com` cookie — letting a cold-connect connect page (served off the API host) read their existing id and fold prior browsing into the proven identity. Pre-consent behaviour (memory-only, no cookie) is unchanged.

  The remaining engine-line packages are version-only bumps to keep the engine release line uniform.

- ed06b92: feat(connectors): @hogsend/plugin-telegram + live-only journey_states unique index

  Adds `@hogsend/plugin-telegram` — an inbound webhook connector (messages, `/start`
  deep-link, `/link` email-confirm cold connect) with journey-callable
  `sendMessage`/`dm` actions and Redis-token linking (peek-then-consume so a Telegram
  webhook retry can't burn a link mid-flight).

  Engine: `uq_user_journey_active` is now a PARTIAL unique index scoped to live rows
  (`status IN ('active','waiting')`) so an `unlimited` journey can complete more than
  once per user — the old full `(user_id, journey_id, status)` index threw `23505` on
  the second completion. Ships migration `0029`. `contacts.properties.telegram` now
  deep-merges (mirrors `discord`).

  All engine-line packages are bumped uniformly to keep the version line and the
  scaffold's caret pins consistent.

- f771ae0: feat(links): generic first-party link tracker — mint, manage, and stitch tracked links outside email

  Extracts the email link-tracking machinery into a channel-agnostic primitive so any
  channel (Studio, Discord, SMS, share links) can mint first-party tracked links.

  - **`@hogsend/engine`**: new `mintLink({ db, url, baseUrl, source, type, label?, campaign?, distinctId?, createdBy? })` — the managed counterpart to the email HTML-rewrite path. Inserts a durable `links` row (operator/campaign identity) plus a `tracked_links` click-counter row that back-references it via `link_id`, and returns the `/v1/t/c/:id` redirect URL. Email is unchanged: it keeps rewriting HTML at send time with `tracked_links.link_id` NULL, so the two stay independent consumers of the same click spine.
  - **Share-safe by construction**: a link is identity-bearing (carries a `distinctId` the click can stitch) ONLY when `type: "personal"`. A `public` link NEVER carries a person token — a reshared public link attributes by campaign only. Destinations are validated http(s) at mint time (closes the latent open-redirect).
  - **Single-use identity-token burn**: the `hs_t` redirect token is now single-use — the first `POST /v1/t/identify` exchange wins; a replayed/reshared token is a 200 no-op (Redis `SET NX` on a sha256 of the token, TTL = token lifetime). Best-effort: a Redis fault degrades to the pre-burn behaviour rather than coupling the exchange to Redis liveness.
  - **`@hogsend/studio`**: a new "Links" view to create and manage tracked links (mint personal/public links, copy the short URL, view per-link click counts, archive). Backed by admin CRUD at `/v1/admin/links` (list/get/create/update/archive), with the click count computed on read from `tracked_links.click_count`.
  - **`@hogsend/db`**: new `links` table + `tracked_links.link_id` FK (additive migration `0028`).

  The remaining engine-line packages are version-only bumps to keep the engine release line uniform (the scaffold pins `^ENGINE_VERSION`).

- 78c9ef6: feat(connectors): connect-DX polish + multi-bot-shaped readiness

  - **`@hogsend/engine`**: the connect-info `ingressSecretConfigured` field is renamed `legacyIngressSecretConfigured` (deprecated, kept one minor) — readiness is now driven off `workerOnline` (the owned heartbeat), since the inline runtime never uses the ingress secret. The connector runtime also logs a loud, actionable error when a configured runtime can't acquire its lease for ~30s (Redis unreachable or contended) instead of silently never connecting (which previously mis-read as "intents not enabled").
  - **`@hogsend/plugin-discord`**: the gateway runtime auto-registers the `/link` + `/verify` slash commands (globally + idempotently) when the socket comes up — no more separate `discord:register-commands` step, and it self-heals after a token rotation. Exports `registerSlashCommands` + `LINK_VERIFY_COMMANDS`.
  - **`@hogsend/cli`**: `hogsend connect discord --status` drops the stale ingress-secret line for `worker online`, adds a worker-offline hint, and returns a 404-specific error when the consumer `/secrets`+`/wire` routes aren't mounted.
  - **`@hogsend/studio`**: the integrations card drops the ingress-secret signal, adds a worker-offline hint panel, and renders the rich gateway card for ANY `transport === "gateway"` connector (not the literal `"discord"` id) — so a second Discord bot would render its own card for free (the seam stays many-bots-shaped).

  The remaining engine-line packages are version-only bumps to keep the engine release line uniform (the scaffold pins `^ENGINE_VERSION`).

### Minor Changes

- 9a87335: feat(engine): the connector runtime — a worker-hosted, leader-leased inbound gateway socket plus a journey-callable outbound action API.

  - **`@hogsend/engine`**: gateway-transport connectors (Discord) now run their long-lived socket **inline inside the Hatchet worker** — no separate service, no `CONNECTOR_INGRESS_SECRET`. A Redis leader lease guarantees exactly one replica holds the socket per bot token, with bounded automatic failover; dispatches feed `transform`→`ingest` in-process, and only the lease-holder writes the (now connector-neutral) liveness heartbeat Studio reads, so "Worker Online / Bot Installed" reflects OWNED liveness a stray process cannot fake. Activation is automatic when a gateway connector + its bot token are present (`ENABLE_CONNECTOR_RUNTIMES`, `CONNECTOR_RUNTIME_HOST=worker` by default). Wire it with `createWorker({ connectorRuntimes: { discord: createDiscordRuntime } })`. The seam is connector-agnostic — a second connector (Slack, …) implements only `defineConnector` + a `ConnectorRuntime` factory and reuses lease election, the heartbeat, and the admin projection unchanged.
  - **`@hogsend/engine`**: outbound actions are a separate, socket-free face — `sendConnectorAction({ connectorId, action, args })` (a standalone import, not on `ctx`) invokes registered `defineConnectorAction`s, independent of the inbound socket (a deployment with the gateway off can still send).
  - **`@hogsend/plugin-discord`**: ships `createDiscordRuntime` (the gateway runtime factory) and `discordActions` (`sendChannelMessage`, `broadcastToChannel`, `mentionMembers`, `mentionRole`, `dmMember`); register the actions via `createHogsendClient({ connectorActions: discordActions })`. The standalone `discord-worker` entry remains as an advanced escape hatch (`CONNECTOR_RUNTIME_HOST=standalone`).

  Additive and opt-in. The remaining engine-line packages are version-only bumps to keep the engine release line uniform (the scaffold pins `^ENGINE_VERSION`).

### Minor Changes

- a637866: feat: AI agent integration — recent-events history read, AI SDK journeys, and Eve durable churn-save

  - **`@hogsend/core` / `@hogsend/engine`**: add `ctx.history.events({ userId, limit?, within? })` — a generic newest-first read of a user's recent events (with `RecentEventsOptions` / `RecentEvent` types), the foundation for assembling agent context bundles.
  - **`@hogsend/engine`**: the webhook-source route now resolves a source's auth secret from `process.env[auth.envKey]` when the engine's validated env doesn't declare that key, so a consumer-defined `signature`/`match` webhook source can bring its own secret. Behavior is unchanged for engine presets and stays fail-closed (an unset `signature` secret is still a 401) — this fixes BYO signature sources (e.g. an Eve HITL callback) that previously could not resolve their secret.
  - **`create-hogsend`**: a freshly scaffolded app now ships a working Tier-1 AI onboarding journey (`src/agents/` + `ctx.history.events()`-backed user context) and gains `ai` + `@ai-sdk/anthropic`; new docs cover the three AI SDK integration tiers (inline, tools, and Eve durable HITL).

  - @hogsend/cli@0.24.0

## 0.23.1

### Patch Changes

- 14296d8: fix(admin): suppressions "All" view listed every contact, and harden two sibling unbounded-query routes

  The admin Suppressions "All" filter built no WHERE clause (`typeFilter` returned
  `undefined`), so Drizzle returned every `email_preferences` row — making every
  contact look suppressed even though none were (deliverability was never affected;
  the send-gate only blocks on `suppressed`/`unsubscribedAll`). The "All" case now
  restricts to genuinely-suppressed recipients (`suppressed OR unsubscribedAll OR
bounceCount > 0`).

  - **preferences PUT**: un-suppressing (`suppressed: false`) now also clears
    `bounceCount`/`lastBounceAt`, so a bounced recipient actually leaves the list
    instead of being pinned there forever.
  - **studio contact drawer**: its un-suppress button now sends `unsubscribedAll:
false` too, so it works for unsubscribed contacts (previously a no-op for them).
  - **bulk events replay**: refuses an unscoped replay (`400`) instead of silently
    re-pushing the most-recent events through ingestion when no `eventIds`/filter
    is given.
  - **sends CSV export**: signals truncation via `X-Hogsend-Export-Truncated` when
    the 50k row cap is hit, so a partial export isn't mistaken for the full history.

- Updated dependencies [14296d8]
  - @hogsend/cli@0.23.1

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- 45f68d3: PostHog identity stitching across web, email, server & Discord.

  Establishes one canonical, ever-identified `distinct_id` per person (the Hogsend
  contact key) and absorbs every other id into it while still anonymous, fixing
  the one-email-many-persons fragmentation.

  - `@hogsend/core`: provider-neutral `mergeIdentities` + `identityMerge`
    capability on the `AnalyticsProvider` contract (both optional; `distinctId` is
    the surviving/canonical id, `alias` the absorbed anonymous one).
  - `@hogsend/plugin-posthog`: `mergeIdentities` via native `client.alias` in the
    correct (PostHog docs) direction, fire-and-forget.
  - `@hogsend/engine`: `mergeAnalyticsIdentities` helper + two resolver emission
    points (collide-merge + key-flip) with identified-key filtering and
    idempotency so a retry never re-aliases; `/v1/events` `anonymousId` threading
    so the contact key can equal the browser anon id (zero-merge); identity-bearing
    tracked links (`link.clicked` event, scoped tokens, server-side alias at
    `/v1/t/identify`) with referral links token-less by default (anti-hijack).
  - `@hogsend/client`: optional `anonymousId` on event/contact inputs.
  - `@hogsend/plugin-discord`: `/link` contact-merge propagates a PostHog merge via
    the shared identity service.

  Additive and off by default; no forced migration. The other engine-line packages
  ride the same minor to keep the version line uniform.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [45f68d3]
  - @hogsend/cli@0.23.0

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- 4a742dd: feat(discord): inbound Gateway connector + outbound destination + in-Discord email linking

  Adds `@hogsend/plugin-discord` — both faces of one integration under
  `meta.id = "discord"`, plus the engine connector subsystem it rides on.

  - **Inbound** — a `transport: "gateway"` connector. A separate long-lived
    Gateway worker (`@hogsend/plugin-discord/gateway`, its own process) dials
    Discord and POSTs raw dispatches to `POST /v1/connectors/discord/ingress`
    (header `x-hogsend-ingress-secret`, env `CONNECTOR_INGRESS_SECRET`, ≥32 chars,
    fail-closed). The server-side transform emits `discord.message_sent`,
    `discord.reaction_added`, `discord.member_joined`, and
    `discord.presence_active` into `ingestEvent` — stored in `user_events` and
    upserted onto a contact. Bot/webhook/system messages and offline/absent
    presence are dropped; each event carries a deterministic `idempotencyKey`.
  - **Identity** — `contacts.discord_id` is a new indexed merge key (a 4th
    identity Kind, with a partial unique index; migration ships in `@hogsend/db`).
    `contacts.properties.discord` carries `id` and derived first-party `last_seen`
    always, plus observed `username`/`global_name`/`avatar`/`joined_at`/`roles`
    (deep-merged one level, non-clobbering; `null` is never written).
  - **In-Discord linking** — `/link` opens an email modal; a valid address mails a
    6-digit single-use code via a transactional template (15-min TTL, bound to the
    invoking Discord user, hashed at rest, rate limited 5/user + 3/email per
    15 min). An "Enter code" button opens a code modal that redeems it and resolves
    the contact via an ephemeral Components-V2 card. `/verify <code>` is the typed
    fallback. Every interaction is ed25519-verified (native `node:crypto`) with a
    ±300s timestamp replay window. A new `connector_link_codes` table backs the
    codes.
  - **Outbound** — `discordDestination` posts one Discord-markdown line per
    lifecycle event to a channel on the durable outbound spine. Wire resolution
    prefers the no-bot-token incoming webhook (`config.webhookUrl`, accepts 204),
    falling back to bot-REST (`config.channelId` + `endpoint.secret`).
  - **Routes** — the engine adds `/v1/connectors/discord/{ingress,interactions,
oauth/callback}` (per-IP rate-limited at 60/min except `/ingress` and
    `/interactions`, which are gated by the ingress secret and ed25519+replay
    respectively). `@hogsend/cli` gains a `connect discord` flow; `@hogsend/studio`
    gains a Discord integration view.

  The package is consumer-mounted (the engine ships no Discord code; wire it with
  `createDiscordConnector` + `createHogsendClient`, and run the Gateway worker as a
  separate process). The one-click `hogsend connect discord` install / OAuth
  member-link is not wired in the dogfood consumer yet (the consumer-mounted
  `secrets`/`wire` admin routes are unmounted), so that CLI path 404s today — the
  env-only inbound path and the modal `/link` are the live identity paths.

  First npm publish of `@hogsend/plugin-discord` is MANUAL — CI cannot create a
  brand-new `@hogsend/*` package.

  `contacts.discord_id` (and `connector_link_codes`) are schema changes — run
  `db:migrate` before deploying.

### Patch Changes

- 4a742dd: fix(connect): purge derived credentials on disconnect, enforce minted secret immediately, validate region URL

  Fast-follows on the one-click PostHog connect:

  - Disconnect (`DELETE /v1/admin/provider-credentials/:providerId`) now purges
    the `derived` credential row (minted webhook secret + grabbed `phc_`) too,
    not just the oauth grant — no orphaned rows linger.
  - The inbound webhook source's secret cache is busted the moment connect mints
    a secret, so it is enforced immediately instead of after the ~30s recheck TTL.
  - Removed the now-unreachable `webhook_secret_missing` 409 branch (the loop
    always resolves or mints a secret before provisioning).
  - The CLI region prompt validates a custom host URL up front instead of
    surfacing a cryptic "Failed to parse URL" during discovery.

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- ccc89ed: feat(connect): one-click PostHog connect — derive key, mint secret, keyless start

  `hogsend connect posthog` becomes the single front door. It runs the OAuth
  handshake first (region via prompt or `--posthog-host`, no `phc_` paste needed),
  mints + persists the webhook secret server-side, creates the PostHog→Hogsend
  webhook destination, and grabs the project's public key on the way through. The
  inbound webhook source resolves the minted secret from the credential store at
  request time, so the loop verifies without a redeploy.

  The OAuth scope set is front-loaded (4 → 13) so future features land without
  forcing a reconnect; `connect-info` surfaces a `scopeGap` to nudge
  already-connected users to re-consent. The `create-hogsend` scaffold makes the
  `phc_` paste optional, pointing at `hogsend connect posthog` instead.

  Engine additions (additive): `getDerivedCredential`/`saveDerivedCredential` +
  `DerivedCredentialPayload`, the `"derived"` `CredentialKind`, and
  `EXPECTED_POSTHOG_SCOPES`.

  Note (deploy ordering): the hosted CIMD document must serve the 13-scope set
  before the new CLI requests it, or PostHog rejects the broader consent.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [ccc89ed]
  - @hogsend/cli@0.21.0

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- e44d400: `hogsend connect posthog` — one command wires the whole PostHog loop. The
  CLI runs a public-client OAuth flow (PKCE S256, loopback callback, no
  client secret; the OAuth server is discovered from your instance's own
  PostHog host so the region is always right and self-hosted instances
  degrade to the personal-key path), stores the credential encrypted at rest
  (new `provider_credentials` table + admin routes; tokens never leave the
  server once stored), and provisions the PostHog → Hogsend webhook
  destination idempotently (adopts an existing destination instead of
  duplicating; refuses when `POSTHOG_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is unset rather than
  wiring an unauthenticated endpoint). Person reads prefer the OAuth token
  and fall back to `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY`; a credential stored at
  runtime is picked up by the running api and worker within ~30 seconds, no
  restart. (The full engine line rides together per release discipline.)
- 9710ced: Contact → analytics-person propagation: the `posthog` destination preset
  gains `config.syncPersons` — `contact.created` / `contact.updated` events
  become `$set` captures of the contact's `properties` under its canonical
  key (the same distinct id the identify loop uses), and a scope-`all`
  `contact.unsubscribed` sets `hogsend_unsubscribed: true`. Privacy-first:
  only `properties` travel, never email or identifiers; without the flag,
  `contact.*` events are skipped (previously they fell through to the
  generic capture branch, which could never address them correctly). The
  engine-seeded destination (`ENABLE_POSTHOG_DESTINATION`) subscribes the
  contact events and enables the flag, reconciling pre-upgrade seeded rows
  without overriding an explicit operator `syncPersons: false`. (The full
  engine line rides together per release discipline.)

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- bbc37e7: Provider-neutral analytics: the `AnalyticsProvider` contract (the analytics
  sibling of `EmailProvider`, authored via `defineAnalyticsProvider`) lands in
  `@hogsend/core`, with person reads (`getPersonProperties`), person writes
  (`setPersonProperties` — `set`/`setOnce`/`unset`), and capture.
  `createHogsendClient`'s `analytics` option now mirrors `email`
  (`{ provider?, providers?, defaultProvider? }`, env preset + consumer-last,
  `ANALYTICS_PROVIDER` selection); legacy `PostHogService` inputs are
  adapter-wrapped and keep working. `client.analyticsProviders` is the registry,
  `client.analytics` the resolved active provider.

  PostHog person reads are FIXED — they were silently dead (the write-only
  `phc_` project key sent to the ingestion host at a legacy path). Reads now use
  `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY` (a personal API key scoped `person:read`) against
  the private API host (derived from `POSTHOG_HOST`, override
  `POSTHOG_PRIVATE_HOST`) with one-shot project-id discovery (override
  `POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID`). Without the personal key, reads soft-fail to contact
  property fallbacks — now surfaced once at boot and by `hogsend doctor`
  instead of silently. Person WRITES need no extra credential (they ride the
  capture pipeline as `$set`/`$set_once`/`$unset`); `createPostHogProvider` is
  the reference implementation. The scaffold's `env.example` documents the
  two-credential model. (The full engine line rides together per release
  discipline.)

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [bbc37e7]
  - @hogsend/cli@0.19.0

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 6434a65: Close the analytics identity loop: `POST /v1/events` now returns `contactKey` —
  the contact's canonical key (`external_id ?? anonymous_id ?? id`), the same key
  outbound destinations emit as `userId` and `hs_t` identity tokens resolve to —
  so a consumer site can `identify()` its analytics session against the contact
  without any PII round-trip.

  To make that key safe to circulate, identity resolution now round-trips it:
  `findByKey` falls back to the contact row id for external-kind lookups (an
  email-only contact's canonical key IS its row id), and a merge records the
  email-only loser's row-id key as an external alias — so a key that left the
  system (Hatchet payloads, destination `userId`s, `hs_t` stitches, forwarded
  PostHog webhooks) always resolves back to the same live contact instead of
  minting a duplicate. (The full engine line rides together per release
  discipline.)

### Patch Changes

- e459fb5: Fix the Studio password-reset link landing on the login card instead of the reset form. The engine's bare `/studio` → `/studio/` redirect dropped the query string, losing better-auth's `?token=…`; the redirect now preserves it, and the Studio's reset redirect targets `/studio/` directly so the link skips the hop entirely. (The full engine line rides together per release discipline.)

  - @hogsend/cli@0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 5fdd9fa: Semantic links follow-ups: the hosted answer page and cross-device identity.

  **Hosted answer page** — a semantic link with no landing page of its own can
  point at the engine: `href={HOSTED_ANSWER_HREF}` (new in `@hogsend/email`)
  resolves at send time to `GET /v1/t/a/:linkId`, a minimal engine-served page
  that confirms the recorded answer and offers a free-text box. Submissions
  ingest as `<event>.comment` (one per send + event, `semc:` idempotency key) —
  a real consumer event journeys can wait on and destinations receive. The
  scaffold's `feedback-checkin` example now lands there by default.

  **Cross-device identity (`hs_t`)** — opt-in via `TRACKING_IDENTITY_TOKEN=true`:
  tracked-link redirects append a one-hour identity token to the destination
  URL; the landing site exchanges it at the new `POST /v1/t/identify` for the
  distinct id and calls `posthog.identify`, merging the email click with the
  web session. Tokens are AES-256-GCM **encrypted** with `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
  (a distinct id can be an email address — nothing readable travels in a URL,
  history entry, or referrer). New exports: `generateIdentityToken`,
  `validateIdentityToken`, `InvalidIdentityTokenError`.

### Patch Changes

### Minor Changes

- ee3b670: Journey `where` builder — code-first trigger/exit conditions.

  `trigger.where` and `exitOn[].where` now accept a builder function alongside
  the declarative array, mirroring bucket criteria:

  ```ts
  trigger: {
    event: "nps.detractor",
    where: (b) => b.prop("score").lte(3),
  },
  ```

  The function resolves ONCE at `defineJourney` time (via the existing
  `criteriaBuilder`) into the byte-identical `PropertyCondition[]` POJOs, so the
  stored `JourneyMeta`, registry zod parse, `checkExits`, admin routes, and
  Studio all keep seeing plain data. Return a single condition or an array
  (AND-ed). New types: `JourneyMetaInput`, `JourneyWhere`, `JourneyWhereBuilder`
  in `@hogsend/core`. Fully backward compatible — the array form is unchanged
  and remains the wire/HTTP format.

### Patch Changes

  - @hogsend/cli@0.15.0

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- b644a01: Semantic email links — in-email surveys, actions & enrichment.

  `EmailAction` (new in `@hogsend/email`) renders an anchor whose click MEANS
  something: it carries an event name + scalar properties that the engine lifts
  into `tracked_links` at send time (the attributes never reach the inbox) and
  emits through the full ingest pipeline at click time. In-email yes/no
  questions, NPS scores, and one-tap choices become real events that route to
  journeys, persist to `user_events`, and fan out to destinations as the new
  `email.action` outbound type (the PostHog preset captures it under the
  consumer's event name).

  - First answer wins per (send, event name) via a `sem:` idempotency key.
    Answers are confirmed by a deferred task after a ~30s window, so scanner
    click-bursts (SafeLinks/Proofpoint) are judged with the WHOLE burst visible
    — including the scanner's first click — before any answer is recorded.
  - `ctx.waitForEvent` now returns `{ timedOut, properties? }` — the matched
    event's payload, so journeys branch on the answer directly (additive,
    backward compatible) — and accepts an optional `lookback` window that checks
    recent `user_events` first, closing the gap where an answer lands between a
    send (or a previous wait) and the wait being established.
  - `tracked_links` gains nullable `event`, `event_properties`,
    `semantic_emitted_at` columns (expand-only migration 0023). Same-URL links
    carrying different answers no longer collapse into one row.
  - Reserved event namespaces (`email.`/`journey.`/`bucket.`/`contact.`) are
    rejected at send time; semantic properties are scalars-only, size-capped.
  - Outbound catalog grows to 14 events (`email.action`) — engine, CLI mirror,
    and client mirror updated. Seeded PostHog destinations subscribe to it, and
    an existing engine-seeded endpoint is reconciled (missing funnel events
    unioned in) at boot. A failed Hatchet publish now rolls back the
    idempotency claim inside `ingestEvent`, so a transient broker error can't
    permanently consume an answer slot.
  - Scaffold ships a `feedback-checkin` example (semantic yes/no email + journey
    reacting via `waitForEvent` properties).
