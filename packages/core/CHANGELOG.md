# @hogsend/core

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Front door: public data-plane API + client SDK.

  Adds the public `/v1` data plane — `contacts` (upsert/find/delete), `events`,
  `emails` (transactional), `lists`, and `campaigns` (broadcast to a list or
  bucket) — behind an API key with a new orthogonal `ingest` scope, plus the new
  `@hogsend/client` SDK. Identity gains email/anonymous keys with a real
  merge/alias resolver (anonymous→identified). Lists are code-defined over the
  existing preference store; campaigns are durable, idempotent, preference-checked
  broadcasts. The CLI moves onto the engine version line and gains write commands.

  The unauthenticated `POST /v1/ingest` is removed — use `POST /v1/events`.
  Event properties no longer merge onto the contact: `contactProperties` write to
  the contact, `eventProperties` to the event (trigger/exit conditions).

### Minor Changes

- cd86e13: Bucket lifecycle: colocated reactions + member access on `defineBucket`

  - Typed transition refs `bucket.entered` / `bucket.left` (literal-typed off the
    bucket's own id) usable directly as journey `trigger` / `exitOn` values.
  - Colocated reactions `bucket.on("enter" | "leave" | "dwell", opts?, handler)`
    that desugar to tagged durable journeys with the full `JourneyContext`.
  - `dwell` reactions driven by the reconcile cron over the existing active
    population, with a historical `dwellAnchorAt` derived during backfill so dwell
    fires for the genuinely long-dwelling population on first deploy.
  - Member access `bucket.count()` / `has()` / `members()` / `membersIterator()`.
  - Studio groups generated reactions under their bucket via `sourceBucketId`.

  Deprecates (kept for one release) the hand-maintained `BucketId` union and the
  `bucketEntered` / `bucketLeft` string helpers in favour of the typed refs. The
  scaffold drops the re-widening `DefinedBucket[]` annotation so literal ids infer.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- f4e604e: Relocate the capability-provider contracts to `@hogsend/core`. The `EmailProvider`
  and `PostHogService` interfaces (and their supporting types — `SendEmailOptions`,
  `BatchEmailItem`, `SendResult`, `WebhookEvent`, `WebhookEventType`,
  `WebhookHandlerMap`, `CaptureOptions`) now live in `@hogsend/core` and are
  re-exported from `@hogsend/engine` as the canonical author import. The vendor
  plugins (`@hogsend/plugin-resend`, `@hogsend/plugin-posthog`) re-export them
  unchanged, so existing imports keep working — no breaking changes. A custom email
  provider now implements `import type { EmailProvider } from "@hogsend/engine"`
  (the contract no longer lives inside the Resend package). See
  `docs/adr/0001-provider-boundary.md`.

  Also makes the injected provider/analytics instances load-bearing: a swapped
  `opts.analytics` is now honored in journey context, the bucket→PostHog sync, and
  worker shutdown (previously these bypassed it via the module singleton), and the
  built-in `send-email` task and alert notifications now deliver through the
  injected `EmailProvider` instead of constructing a raw Resend client — so a
  swapped provider takes effect everywhere. The `send-email` task no longer
  double-retries on top of the provider's own retry loop.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0db58c6: Add `ctx.waitForEvent({ event, timeout })` — a durable journey primitive that pauses a journey until the enrolled user emits a specific event (or a timeout elapses), then resumes. The wait is user-scoped and forward-looking; an `exitOn` match (or cancellation) during the wait aborts the run cleanly via `JourneyExitedError`, marks the state `"exited"`, and cancels the in-flight Hatchet run so no post-wait side effects fire. Also hardens `exitOn` to cancel suspended `ctx.sleep`/`ctx.waitForEvent` runs instead of letting them resume after exit.

### Minor Changes

- aac7394: Buckets feature-complete — fluent criteria builder, dormancy joins, and a journey-aligned `entryLimit` rename

  Rounds the Buckets primitive out to a complete dynamic-membership feature and aligns its vocabulary with journeys.

  **BREAKING (cheap now, at ~zero adoption): `reentry` → `entryLimit`.** `BucketMeta.reentry`/`reentryPeriod` are renamed to `entryLimit`/`entryPeriod` to match `defineJourney` exactly (same `"once" | "once_per_period" | "unlimited"` values). The `/v1/admin/buckets` responses use the new keys too. Rename the field in your `defineBucket` calls. Note: on a bucket, `entryLimit` throttles the emitted `bucket:entered` _event_ — membership itself is always live (it re-computes every time criteria match); the journey a bucket triggers has its own `entryLimit` for enrollment.

  - `@hogsend/core` — `defineBucket` `criteria` now accepts a fluent builder
    `(b) => b.all(b.event(X).exists(), b.event(X).within(days(7)).notExists())`
    alongside the declarative `ConditionEval` tree. It runs once at definition time
    and returns the same canonical data, so registry indexes, schema validation,
    the reconcile cron, and Studio are unaffected. The declarative form still works.
  - `@hogsend/engine` — absence-shaped buckets auto-enable the cron join path so
    lapsed-active "went dormant" buckets materialize ongoing without a config flag
    (opt out with `reconcileJoins: false`); single-event and composite absence
    joins are bounded by an exists-ever floor that excludes never-active users.
    Precise `entryLimit: "once_per_period"` — the `bucket:entered:<id>` emit is
    suppressed until `entryPeriod` has elapsed since the most-recent prior leave
    (membership + `entryCount` still advance; an undefined `entryPeriod` emits as
    before). **Boot-time backfill now actually fires** — it was previously placed
    after the blocking `worker.start()` and never ran; it is now triggered before
    the listener (fire-and-forget) so new/changed buckets seed existing matching
    contacts on deploy (silently, no `bucket:entered`), with entry-count and
    live-contact parity. Registering `kind:"manual"` throws at startup
    (`not implemented in v1`) instead of registering a silently-inert bucket.
  - `@hogsend/studio` — the bucket detail panel surfaces `maxDwell` as a
    `Time-boxed · <dwell>` badge.
  - `create-hogsend` — the scaffold's example bucket uses `entryLimit`.

  No new migration — `max_dwell_at`, `left_at`, and `criteria_hash` already exist.
  The canonical `went-dormant` example is now a lapsed-active composite (active at
  some point, but not in the last 7 days), so it excludes never-active signups.

  Hardening (from a full pre-release review): the cron join path is gated by
  `entryLimit` (no re-emit on every tick after re-dormancy); a brand-new absence
  bucket does NOT blast historically-dormant users into journeys (the cron join
  path waits for the first-time backfill to claim them silently); the safe absence
  shapes (single-event `not_exists within` and the lapsed-active composite) join
  via an exact set-based query (no per-member starvation), and other absence
  composites require an explicit `reconcileJoins: true`; backfill and cron agree on
  never-active exclusion; composite backfill is keyset-paged. Deferred to 0.3.1
  (non-gating): parallelizing the per-event candidate evaluation on the ingest hot
  path, and dedicated indexes (`user_events(event, occurred_at, user_id)` and an
  `entryLimit` cooldown index).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 31e5ed7: Add Buckets — first-class, code-defined segments with real-time membership

  `defineBucket()` introduces named membership groups as a peer primitive to
  journeys. A user joins a bucket the moment their data satisfies its criteria and
  leaves when it stops; each transition emits `bucket:entered` / `bucket:left`
  (plus per-bucket aliases `bucket:entered:<id>` / `bucket:left:<id>`) through the
  ingest pipeline, so a bucket join/leave can trigger a journey via the journey's
  `trigger.event` (Hatchet `onEvents`). Criteria reuse the existing `@hogsend/core`
  condition engine.

  - `@hogsend/core` — `BucketMeta`, `bucketMetaSchema`, and `BucketRegistry`
    (event/property indexes for candidate narrowing).
  - `@hogsend/db` — `bucket_memberships` (re-entry-safe partial unique active
    index) and `bucket_configs` tables on the engine migration track.
  - `@hogsend/engine` — `defineBucket`, real-time inclusion/exclusion evaluation
    inside the ingest pipeline (recursion-guarded, transition-only emission), an
    engine-owned cron reconciliation for time-based/absence leaves, opt-in
    fast-expiry timers, an unconditional `maxDwell` membership TTL (force-leave N
    after joining regardless of criteria; re-entry governed by `reentry`), backfill
    - criteria-change re-evaluation, admin routes (`/v1/admin/buckets`), an optional
      off-by-default PostHog person-property sync, and `buckets` / `ENABLED_BUCKETS`
      wiring on `createHogsendClient` and `createWorker`.
  - `@hogsend/studio` — an observe-only Buckets view (size, enter/leave over time,
    which journeys a bucket feeds).
  - `create-hogsend` — the scaffold template ships a `src/buckets/` example and the
    client/worker wiring.

  All changes are additive; existing journeys, the engine factories, and consumer
  types are unaffected. Consumers pick up a new engine-track migration applied by
  the standard pre-deploy `db:migrate`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 94a0bd4: Timezone-aware scheduling, send windows, and per-recipient frequency capping.

  - **`createHogsendClient({ defaults })`** — new `defaults.timezone` (global fallback IANA tz), `defaults.sendWindow` (quiet-hours window auto-applied by `ctx.when`), and `defaults.frequencyCap` (per-recipient send cap enforced in the mailer; "transactional" exempt by default).
  - **`ctx.when(...)`** on the journey context — resolves a send instant in the recipient's timezone and snaps it inside the configured send window.
  - **Timezone resolution** — new `resolveTimezone` / `resolveTimezoneWithSource` / `setContactTimezone` (`@hogsend/engine`) with a precedence chain (explicit → PostHog person props → `contacts.timezone` cache → global default), plus explicit-tz validation.
  - **`@hogsend/core/schedule`** — new public schedule module (window/time/tz resolvers).
  - **`isFrequencyCapped`** + `FrequencyCapConfig` / `FrequencyCapWindow` exports.

  Includes additive migration `0009` (expand-only): a nullable `contacts.timezone` column and an `email_sends` frequency-cap index. **After upgrading, run `db:migrate`** — the boot guard reports `schema.engine.inSync` until applied. No backfill required (the tz column is an opportunistic cache below PostHog/properties in precedence).
