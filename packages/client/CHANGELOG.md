## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e2e254c: feat: outbound webhooks + integration presets

  Adds a Svix-style HMAC-signed outbound webhook stream — a 12-event catalog,
  managed endpoints (`/v1/admin/webhooks` CRUD + rotate-secret + test), and
  durable delivery (per-endpoint retry/backoff, dead-letter, and a 1-minute
  reaper that re-drives due retries and recovers orphaned `sending` rows). The
  `hs.webhooks.*` client resource ships with `verifyHogsendWebhook` (svix +
  node:crypto fallback), and the CLI gains a `hogsend webhooks` command.

  Adds inbound integration presets (Clerk, Supabase `auth.users`, Stripe,
  Segment) as `defineWebhookSource` presets, enabled by env. The webhook-source
  auth contract is widened to a discriminated union with a fail-closed
  `signature` scheme (svix / Stripe `node:crypto` / generic HMAC-hex), and the
  route reads the raw body once so signatures verify against the exact bytes.

  All engine-line packages move together on the version line so the scaffold's
  caret pins keep resolving.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Front door: public data-plane API + client SDK.

  Adds the public `/v1` data plane — `contacts` (upsert/find/delete), `events`,
  `emails` (transactional), `lists`, and `campaigns` (broadcast to a list or
  bucket) — behind an API key with a new orthogonal `ingest` scope, plus the new
  `@hogsend/client` SDK. Identity gains email/anonymous keys with a real
  merge/alias resolver (anonymous→identified). Lists are code-defined over the
  existing preference store; campaigns are durable, idempotent, preference-checked
  broadcasts. The CLI moves onto the engine version line and gains write commands.

  The unauthenticated `POST /v1/ingest` is removed — use `POST /v1/events`.
  Event properties no longer merge onto the contact: `contactProperties` write to
  the contact, `eventProperties` to the event (trigger/exit conditions).
