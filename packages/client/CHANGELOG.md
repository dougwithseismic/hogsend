- 7229385: feat: outbound destinations on the delivery spine (PostHog/Segment/Slack)

  Turns the durable outbound webhook spine into a fan-out engine: a new
  `kind` column on `webhook_endpoints` selects a delivery-time TRANSFORM adapter,
  so a keyed destination (PostHog, Segment, Slack, or a code-defined
  `defineDestination()`) reuses ALL the existing retry/backoff/DLQ/reaper/CAS
  machinery — only the per-vendor HTTP projection differs. The default
  `kind="webhook"` signed Standard-Webhooks POST is byte-identical to before.
  `@hogsend/client` and `@hogsend/engine` move together on this version line so
  the SDK types can never describe a server response shape the engine does not
  yet return.

  ## Consumer-visible behavioral changes (read before upgrading)

  - **BREAKING: `ctx.posthog.capture` and `ctx.identify` were REMOVED from the
    journey context.** These were single-vendor, fire-and-forget PostHog shims;
    they no longer exist on `JourneyContext` (`@hogsend/core`). Now that PostHog is
    just one outbound DESTINATION among many, the journey context exposes only
    vendor-neutral orchestration primitives (`sleep`, `sleepUntil`, `when`,
    `waitForEvent`, `checkpoint`, `trigger`, `guard`, `history`). To send the
    lifecycle catalog (`contact.*`, `email.*`, `journey.completed`, `bucket.*`) to
    PostHog/Segment/Slack/a CRM, configure an outbound destination. For a custom
    journey signal, fire `ctx.trigger()` (it joins the internal pipeline) and
    capture it where you detect it via your app's PostHog SDK. The `PostHogService`
    provider itself is unchanged and still load-bearing for the identity PULL
    (`getPersonProperties` → timezone resolution) and the opt-in
    `bucket.syncToPostHog` person-property mirror.

  - **Open/click are now PER-HIT, not first-touch.** Previously `email.opened` /
    `email.clicked` emitted exactly ONCE per send (a first-touch gate plus a
    per-send `dedupeKey` of `email.opened:<id>` / `email.clicked:<id>`). They now
    emit on EVERY open and EVERY click with NO `dedupeKey`, so every hit is a
    distinct delivery to every subscribed endpoint. This is intentional — every
    destination must receive every engagement event — and it is the right shape
    for product-analytics destinations (PostHog/Segment per-hit funnels). The
    per-delivery wire bytes for `kind="webhook"` subscribers are UNCHANGED, but a
    live subscriber to `email.opened` / `email.clicked` will now receive many
    deliveries per send instead of one. This is defensible under the documented
    at-least-once + `Webhook-Id` dedup model (each delivery still carries a unique
    `Webhook-Id`), but it is NOT a no-op for existing production endpoints
    subscribed to those two events — size your consumer + dedup accordingly. The
    row-level `emailSends.openedAt` / `clickedAt` first-touch state is unchanged.

  - **`@hogsend/client` outbound-webhook return types gained nullability** to
    model keyed destinations (which carry no signing secret). `WebhookEndpoint.secretPrefix`
    is now `string | null` (null for `kind !== "webhook"`), and
    `CreatedWebhookEndpoint` is now `WebhookEndpoint & { secret?: string }` (the
    full secret is present only for `kind="webhook"`). Under `strictNullChecks`,
    consumer code that read `endpoint.secretPrefix` as a non-null `string`, or
    `created.secret` as a guaranteed `string` on the create/rotate "store it now"
    flow, will get a TS error — narrow before use (the secret is still always
    present for `kind="webhook"` creates at runtime). This ships in lockstep with
    the engine route change that makes the server actually return those nulls.

  - **The admin `kind` enum now accepts every shipped preset.** `POST`/`PATCH
/v1/admin/webhooks` previously rejected `kind` values other than
    `"webhook"`/`"posthog"` with a 400; it now accepts any shipped preset id
    (`webhook`, `posthog`, `segment`, `slack`), derived from `PRESET_DESTINATIONS`
    so the catalog stays the single source of truth. This makes the
    admin-API / `hs.webhooks` SDK path documented in the destinations skill +
    `env.example` actually reachable for `segment`/`slack` endpoints (a `kind`
    whose transform is not registered at delivery still DLQs as a config error).

  ## What's new

  - `defineDestination()` + a `DestinationRegistry`, threaded into
    `createHogsendClient({ destinations })` and `createWorker`. Four shipped
    presets: `webhook` (default), `posthog`, `segment`, `slack`.
  - `ENABLED_DESTINATION_PRESETS` env (csv / `*` / `none`) selects which optional
    presets register; `webhook` + `posthog` are always on. Destination credentials
    are per-endpoint in `webhook_endpoints.config`, never env vars.
  - `ENABLE_POSTHOG_DESTINATION` auto-seeds one `kind="posthog"` endpoint on the
    email funnel so the full email lifecycle fans out to PostHog DURABLY.
  - A new `hogsend-authoring-destinations` skill.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e2e254c: feat: outbound webhooks + integration presets

  Adds a Svix-style HMAC-signed outbound webhook stream — a 12-event catalog,
  managed endpoints (`/v1/admin/webhooks` CRUD + rotate-secret + test), and
  durable delivery (per-endpoint retry/backoff, dead-letter, and a 1-minute
  reaper that re-drives due retries and recovers orphaned `sending` rows). The
  `hs.webhooks.*` client resource ships with `verifyHogsendWebhook` (svix +
  node:crypto fallback), and the CLI gains a `hogsend webhooks` command.

  Adds inbound integration presets (Clerk, Supabase `auth.users`, Stripe,
  Segment) as `defineWebhookSource` presets, enabled by env. The webhook-source
  auth contract is widened to a discriminated union with a fail-closed
  `signature` scheme (svix / Stripe `node:crypto` / generic HMAC-hex), and the
  route reads the raw body once so signatures verify against the exact bytes.

  All engine-line packages move together on the version line so the scaffold's
  caret pins keep resolving.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Front door: public data-plane API + client SDK.

  Adds the public `/v1` data plane — `contacts` (upsert/find/delete), `events`,
  `emails` (transactional), `lists`, and `campaigns` (broadcast to a list or
  bucket) — behind an API key with a new orthogonal `ingest` scope, plus the new
  `@hogsend/client` SDK. Identity gains email/anonymous keys with a real
  merge/alias resolver (anonymous→identified). Lists are code-defined over the
  existing preference store; campaigns are durable, idempotent, preference-checked
  broadcasts. The CLI moves onto the engine version line and gains write commands.

  The unauthenticated `POST /v1/ingest` is removed — use `POST /v1/events`.
  Event properties no longer merge onto the contact: `contactProperties` write to
  the contact, `eventProperties` to the event (trigger/exit conditions).
