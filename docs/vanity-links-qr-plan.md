# Vanity Links + QR Codes — Execution Plan

Two features layered on the managed link tracker (`mintLink` / Studio Links / `/v1/admin/links`, shipped 0.27.0):

1. **Vanity links** — an operator-chosen slug that sits over the top of the UUID short link. `/l/black-friday` resolves the same click pipeline as `/v1/t/c/<uuid>`. Slugs are unique per instance, normalized lowercase, and live on the `links` row (managed links only — email's per-send rewritten links stay UUID-only).
2. **Per-link QR codes** — every managed link can produce a QR code with its own durable key: a second `tracked_links` row (`source: "qr"`) minted lazily per link. The QR encodes `/v1/t/c/<qrTrackedLinkId>` (the durable UID URL, **never** the slug — printed codes must survive slug changes). Retargeting already works: `PATCH /v1/admin/links/:id` updates all `tracked_links` rows scoped by `link_id`. Scans are distinguishable from clicks (`source: "qr"` rides the existing `link.clicked` outbound payload).

## Design decisions

- **Slug rules**: 1–64 chars, `[a-z0-9-]`, no leading/trailing hyphen; input normalized to lowercase before validation. Unique index on `links.slug`. Conflicts → 409. Slug is settable at mint, changeable/clearable via PATCH (`slug: null` frees it). Archived links keep their slug reserved and keep resolving (matches UUID-redirect behavior today).
- **Vanity route**: `GET /l/:slug` mounted at the app root (outside `/v1`) — `/l` collides with nothing (`/v1`, `/studio`, `/docs`, `/api/auth`, `/connectors`, webhooks). Resolution: `links` by slug → canonical tracked row (`source IS DISTINCT FROM 'qr'`) → the exact same click pipeline as `/v1/t/c/:id` (extracted into a shared function, not duplicated, not a double redirect).
- **QR spine**: no new table. `ensureQrTrackedLink()` lazily select-or-inserts the per-link QR row, guarded against races by a partial unique index on `tracked_links(link_id) WHERE source = 'qr'`. `distinctId` copied from the link (personal links' scans still stitch `hs_t`).
- **Aggregates**: `aggregateFor` splits with SQL `FILTER` — `clickCount` stays the total across all rows, `scanCount` = QR-only subtotal, `trackedLinkId` = the canonical non-QR row (today's `min(id)` would pick the QR row arbitrarily).
- **QR generation**: `qrcode` npm package (server-side SVG + PNG, no canvas). New engine dep ⇒ **must** be mirrored in `packages/create-hogsend/template/_package.json` (consumer CJS/ESM boot-crash gotcha, see #263).
- **Admin QR endpoint**: `GET /v1/admin/links/{id}/qr?format=svg|png&size=` behind `requireAdmin`. Studio previews via same-origin `<img>` (session cookie rides along).

## Quality gates (every feature)

`pnpm check-types` · `pnpm lint` · `pnpm build` · `cd apps/api && pnpm test` (docker TimescaleDB on :5434 must be up)

## Status legend

`[ ]` todo · `[~]` built-to-seam (human ask recorded) · `[x]` done

## Phase 1 — Vanity slugs

- [x] 1.1 Slug foundation: `links.slug` column + unique index (migration via `pnpm db:generate`), slug normalize/validate helper, `mintLink({ slug })` + `MintedLink.slug`/`vanityUrl`, admin `POST /v1/admin/links` accepts `slug` (400 invalid, 409 taken), `PATCH` sets/changes/clears slug, `slug` + `vanityUrl` in all link responses — with integration tests (mint, case-normalize, dup 409, clear-and-reuse)
- [x] 1.2 Vanity redirect: extract the shared click pipeline from `routes/tracking/click.ts`, add root-mounted `GET /l/:slug` running it (404→redirect-home behavior matching UUID route), tests (302 + `link_clicks`/`click_count` side effects, retarget reflected, archived slug still resolves, unknown slug)
- [x] 1.3 Studio: slug field in create + edit dialogs (client-side validation mirroring engine), vanity short link shown/copyable in table + reveal dialog, 409 surfaced inline

## Phase 2 — QR codes

- [x] 2.1 QR scan spine: partial unique index migration (`tracked_links(link_id) WHERE source='qr'`), `ensureQrTrackedLink()`, `aggregateFor` FILTER split (`scanCount`, canonical `trackedLinkId`, `qrTrackedLinkId`), `scanCount` in admin link responses — with tests (lazy mint idempotent under race, scan increments scanCount not conflated, retarget covers QR row)
- [x] 2.2 QR endpoint: add `qrcode` dep to engine (+ `@types/qrcode` dev, + mirror in create-hogsend template `_package.json`), `GET /v1/admin/links/{id}/qr` (svg default, png, `size` param, sensible cache headers), encodes durable `/v1/t/c/<qrTrackedLinkId>` — with tests (content-type, deterministic payload URL, 404, lazy-mints the row)
- [x] 2.3 Studio: QR action per link row → dialog with live preview, PNG/SVG download, scan count; scans surfaced in list view

## Phase 3 — Docs + release prep

- [x] 3.1 `docs/tracking.md`: managed links / vanity slugs / QR section (doc is currently email-only and stale w.r.t. 0.27); changeset for the engine line (minor: engine, db, studio, create-hogsend)

## Round 2 design decisions (Doug 2026-07-10)

- **Export UI**: `SplitButton<T>` already exists, generic but private, in `packages/studio/src/views/journeys/journey-flow.tsx:409-560` (persists last-picked id under `storageKey`; `onAct` fires on primary click AND menu select). Extract verbatim to `src/components/ui/split-button.tsx`, re-import in journey-flow (no behavior change). The QR export is server-rendered (`linkQrUrl`), so the QR dialog gets its own item list — it does NOT reuse the journeys' html-to-image path.
- **Transparent PNG**: `transparent=true` query param on `/qr`; qrcode `color.light: "#0000"`. Applies to SVG too (transparent background), honest for both formats.
- **Standalone QR = a lens, not a new table.** "A QR code" is any managed link whose QR scan row exists (`tracked_links` `source='qr'`). The Studio "QR codes" view lists links `hasQr=true` (admin list filter via EXISTS); "New QR code" mints a link (label + description + destination, no slug required) and immediately lazy-mints/shows its QR. No parallel schema — the links table stays the single spine.
- **Per-destination stats**: stamp `link_clicks.destination_url` at click time (the pre-token redirect target) instead of a retarget-history table — per-hit provenance answers "stats per destination epoch" directly, works for ALL tracked links, and legacy rows bucket as `url: null`. `GET /v1/admin/links/:id` gains `destinations: [{ url, clicks, scans, firstAt, lastAt }]`.
- **Bulk identification**: `links.description` (nullable text) — settable at mint + PATCH, shown in QR views.
- **apps/docs**: extend the EXISTING `content/docs/guides/link-tracking.mdx` (it already name-drops QR codes) rather than minting a new page; docs gate = `pnpm --filter @hogsend/docs check-types` (regenerates fumadocs source map). NO landing/mega-menu changes this round — flagged for Doug's preview-before-merge flow if wanted later.

## Phase 4 — QR export polish

- [x] 4.1 Engine: `transparent` boolean query param on `GET /v1/admin/links/:id/qr` (PNG + SVG via `color.light "#0000"`) — with tests (both formats 200 + differ from opaque output; PNG stays valid signature)
- [x] 4.2 Studio: extract `SplitButton`/`SplitItem` to `components/ui/split-button.tsx` (journey-flow imports it, zero behavior change); QR dialog swaps the two anchors for a SplitButton — items PNG / PNG transparent / SVG — triggering the download via a synthesized `<a download>` on `linkQrUrl(...)`

## Phase 5 — Standalone QR codes (print marketing)

- [x] 5.1 Destination provenance + description: migration (`links.description`, `link_clicks.destination_url`), click pipeline stamps the redirect target per hit, `mintLink({ description })` + admin create/PATCH/responses carry `description` — with tests (stamp recorded on click + scan; retarget → new stamps carry the new URL; description round-trips)
- [x] 5.2 Per-destination stats: `GET /v1/admin/links/:id` gains `destinations` array (url, clicks, scans, firstAt, lastAt; NULL bucket for pre-feature rows) — with tests (retarget mid-life → two buckets with correct scan/click splits)
- [x] 5.3 Admin list `hasQr` filter (EXISTS on the QR scan row) — with tests
- [x] 5.4 Studio "QR codes" view: nav item + route; lists `hasQr` links (label, description, destination, scans, created); "New QR code" dialog (destination + label + description → mint + immediately open the QR dialog); QR dialog gains description + per-destination breakdown table + inline retarget; Links view create/edit dialogs gain the optional description field

## Phase 6 — Docs round 2

- [x] 6.1 `apps/docs` guide: extend `content/docs/guides/link-tracking.mdx` with vanity slugs, QR codes (durable-by-construction story), per-destination stats + print-marketing retarget walkthrough (docs register: every line a fact); gate with docs check-types
- [x] 6.2 Update `docs/tracking.md` + the pending changeset (`.changeset/vanity-links-qr-codes.md`) to cover transparent export, description, destination stats, hasQr lens

## Round 3 — arrival attribution (Doug 2026-07-10; design adversarially reviewed)

"Did an existing identified user scan this QR?" — opt-in per link (`links.append_ref`), the redirect appends `hs_ref=<link_clicks.id>` (raw per-hit UUID, provenance not identity), the landing page reports it back to `POST /v1/t/arrive` with identity evidence (userToken = trusted; raw anon id = provenance-only + `restrictToAnonymous` clamp + identified-collision guard BEFORE stamping), engine stamps first-write-wins (`visitor_distinct_id`, `visitor_kind`, `arrived_at`) and emits journey-triggerable `link.arrived` (ingest subject ALWAYS read from the stamped row; `idempotencyKey link:arrived:<ref>`; outbound only on fresh store; uniform `200 {ok:true}` — no oracle). `hs_t` stays orthogonal. Single URL-build pass so hs_ref never clobbers hs_t. Invariant with test: nothing the ref resolves to (esp. `links.distinct_id`) ever enters the contact resolver as a subject. Full contract: `.claude/plans/elegant-twirling-ripple.md`.

## Phase 7 — Arrival spine (engine)

- [x] 7.1 Schema + redirect ref: migration 0040 (`links.append_ref`, `link_clicks.visitor_distinct_id`/`visitor_kind`/`arrived_at`), explicit click UUID + single URL-build pass appending `hs_ref` when opted in, `mintLink({ appendRef })` + admin wiring — tests (param on/off, hs_t coexistence, raw destinationUrl)
- [x] 7.2 `POST /v1/t/arrive` + `link.arrived` (bus + outbound catalog) — tests (token/anon/collision/replay/self-heal/no-oracle/invariant)
- [x] 7.3 Admin surfacing: arrivals in link detail + stamp fields on clicks[] — tests

## Phase 8 — Client capture

- [x] 8.1 `@hogsend/js` captureRef (auto on init when `hs_ref` present, default on, config off-switch, manual export, replaceState cleanup); verify via typecheck/build + live flow (no js test suite)

## Phase 9 — Studio + docs

- [ ] 9.1 Studio: "Append arrival ref" toggle (QR create default ON with OAuth-redirect caveat; Links create/edit default OFF), known-arrival display in QR dialog + detail
- [ ] 9.2 Docs (guides/link-tracking.mdx arrival section + client-side captureRef page + docs/tracking.md) and changesets (extend 0.41.0 engine-line + new @hogsend/js)

## Seam notes

No external seams expected — no vendor credentials, no paid infra. `qrcode` is a plain npm dep. Release/publish itself is out of scope for this loop (batched per calm-release discipline; needs Doug's nod). Dogfood app pickup happens via `hogsend upgrade` after release.
